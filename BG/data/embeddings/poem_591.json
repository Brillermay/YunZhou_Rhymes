抒情 思念\n文学赏析：《毛诗序》说：“《东山），周公东征（平武庚、管叔之乱）也。周公东征三年而归，劳归士。大夫美之，故作是诗也。”此说无确据。朱熹《诗集传》以为“此周公劳归士词，非大夫美之而作”。说“非大夫美之而作”是，但说“周公劳士之作”则未必然。因为从诗的内容看，这实在是一首征人解甲还乡途中抒发思乡之情的诗，事或与周公东征相关，却不必是周公所作。\n全诗四章，章首四句叠咏，文字全同，构成了全诗的主旋律。咏的是士卒在归来的途中，遇到淫雨天气，在写法上与《小雅·采薇》末章“昔我往矣。杨柳依依；今我来思，雨雪霏霏”相近。王夫之说“以乐景写哀，复以哀景写乐，一倍增其哀乐”，这里既是“以哀景写乐”，又不全是。盖行者思家，在雨雪纷飞之际会倍感凄迷，所以这几句也是情景交融，为每章后面几句的叙事准备了一个颇富感染力的背景。\n每章的后四句，则是叙事性内容；大抵可分为前后两部分。\n前两章写主人公还乡途中的悲喜交集，喜胜于悲的心情。诗人首先抓住着装的改变这一细节，写战士复员，解甲归田之喜，反映了人民对战争的厌倦，对和平生活的渴望。其次写归途餐风宿露，夜住晓行的辛苦。把诗中人比作桑林的野蚕，颇有意味：令读者感到他辛苦是辛苦，但也有摆脱羁勒，得其所哉的喜悦。（一说这几句是写回忆军中生活，虽也可通，总不如解为直叙归途中事顺理成章）二章写途中想像家园荒芜、民生凋敝，倍增怀念之情。诗中所写的杂草丛生、野兽昆虫出没、磷火闪烁的景象，与汉乐府“十五从军征”，及曹操《蒿里行》所写类似，可见战士家乡当时发生过较大规模的战乱，难怪在家乡越来越近时，诗中人的心境更加复杂。一方面是“近乡情更怯”，另一方面则是“近乡情更‘切’”。所以诗人一面写着可畏的景象，一面又说着“不可畏也，伊可怀也”那样自相矛盾的话。\n后两章承上写主人公途中的想像，却是专写对妻子的怀思。有推想妻在家中的忧思（“妇叹于室”），有回忆新婚的情景，也有对久别重逢的想像。诗中特别提到葫芦（瓜瓠），是因为古代婚俗：夫妇合卺时须剖瓠为瓢，彼此各执一瓢，盛酒漱口以成礼。这里言在物而意在人。末章进而回忆三年前举行婚礼的情景，写莺歌燕舞，迎亲的车马喜气洋洋，丈母娘为新娘子结上佩巾，把做媳妇的规矩叮咛又叮咛（“亲结其缡，九十其仪”）。这些快乐情景既与前文的“妇叹于室”形成对比，同时还暗示着主人公曾经有过“新婚别”的悲痛经历。回忆还会引起诗中人对重逢更强烈的渴望。俗话说“久别胜新婚”，诗的结尾说：“其新孔嘉，其旧如之何！”既是想入非非的，又是合情合理的：因为在古代农业社会，人际关系较为单纯，夫妇关系实是最深挚的一种人际关系。战士在军中及归途更多地想到妻子，特别是“暮婚晨告别”的妻子，是再自然不过的事体。\n此诗最大的艺术特色之一是丰富的联想，它也许是国风中想像力最为丰富的一首诗，诗中有再现、追忆式的想像（如对新婚的回忆），也有幻想、推理式的想像（如对家园残破的想像），于“道途之远、岁月之久、风雨之凌犯、饥渴之困顿、裳衣之久而垢敝、室庐之久而荒废、室家之久而怨思”（朱善），皆有情貌无遗的描写。而放在章首的叠咏，则起到了咏叹的作用，这咏叹就像一根红线，将诗中所有片断的追忆和想像串联起来，使之成为浑融完美的艺术整体。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"591","poet":"先秦
