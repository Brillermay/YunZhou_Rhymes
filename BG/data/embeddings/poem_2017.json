宋之问\n正文：度岭方辞国，停轺一望家。\n魂随南翥鸟，泪尽北枝花。\n山雨初含霁，江云欲变霞。\n但令归有日，不敢恨长沙。\n分类：写景 抒情\n文学赏析：此诗真实生动地叙述了作者过大庾岭的情景，情感凄楚悲凉，真挚感人。\n起句“度岭方辞国”，扣题直叙，说明诗人已经来到“华夷”分界的梅岭之巅，将要走出中原，辞别故国了。大庾岭在古人心目中是腹地和南部边陲的分野，是文明和蛮荒的界限。此去身陷边鄙，祸福难科，家阻万山，赋归无期，忆往思来，百感交集。此句一个“方”字把“度岭”“辞国”联系在一起，顿然使人产生一种摇曳心旌的感觉，使文势陡率而高远。对句“停轺一望家”，诗人停下长途跋涉的驿车，在中原与“夷国”的边界驻足远望家乡的方向。此刻站在高高的山岭上，还能望长安于日下，指故里于云间，而“明朝望乡处，应见岭头梅”（《题大庾岭北驿》），其它全被山岭遮住了。因此，要抓紧时机，停下车来，滞留山头，深情地向家园方向再望一次。至此，一个失魂落魄的遭贬谪的宦游人的形象展现在读者面前了。这“一望”的“一”字，也甚为传神，传达出诗人去国怀乡的深沉感情。\n颔联“魂随南翥鸟，泪尽北枝花”，紧承首联中的“望”字而来，诗人遥望乡关，只见鸟儿飞翔，花儿开放。据说大庾岭南北气候差异，南枝谢了，北枝才开。人在岭北，犹如花开枝头；一入岭南，就像花残凋落。诗人眼中的鸟儿是“南翥”，花儿是“北枝”，因此触动了北人南迁的情思。心向北，身往南，距离越拉越大，矛盾痛苦越来越深，诗人的魂魄和思绪都随着那向南飞翔的故乡之鸟而去了，那岭北绽放的梅花却多情地向他频送春光。此景此情，使他黯然神伤。这联诗写得情景交融，将诗人魂断庾岭的情态表现得淋漓尽致。\n颈联“山雨初含霁，江云欲变霞”，上句写山雨欲停未停，天空已放出些许晴光。下句是描绘江中云影即将变作彩霞的霎那间。这两句专门写景，避免正面表达感情，迂回取道，曲径通幽，在结构上是转折，在情绪上是顿挫，宕开一笔，别开生面。诗人描写景色的渐变，衬托自己心情的变化。“初含”、“欲变”等字眼，赋予云雨以灵性。写云，不直接表现天空的云，而是描绘江中的倒影。可见山雨是濛濛细雨。这样写可以一箭双雕，将山的空明、水的澄澈同时生动地表现出来了。诗人在《早发大庾岭》诗里写道：“晨跻大庾险，驿鞍驰复息。雾露昼未开，浩途不可测。兄弟远沦居，妻子成异域。羽翮伤已毁，童幼怜未识。踌躇恋北顾，亭午晞霁色。春暖阴梅花，瘴回阳鸟翼。”由此可知《度大庾岭》是《早发大庾岭》的续篇。这首诗中写的“山雨初含霁”，大约是在中午或午后；“江云欲变霞”，可能是在下午或傍晚。\n在这样美好的山水景色中，诗人的心潮逐渐趋于平静，开始振作起来面对现实考虑自己的出路。在《早发大庾岭》里有这样的诗句：“适蛮悲疾首，怀恐泪沾臆。感谢鹓鹭朝，勤修魑魅职。生还倘非远，誓以报恩德。”可见他希望勤奋修职，争取早日赦归。由于天气的好转，诗人心情也逐渐开朗，由天气的变化联想到自己的命运，也充满了希望。于是不禁发出了“但令归有日，不敢恨长沙”的感慨，表示他只希望有回去的那天，就心满意足了，对自己受贬迁不敢有所怨恨。这是用了西汉贾谊遭权臣们排挤被贬为长沙王太傅的典故，说自己不敢像贾谊谪居长沙时那样因不适应湿热的气候“自以为寿不得长”而心生“恨”意。这种以退为进的写法，更把那希望生还的拳拳之心衬托了出来。尾联以直抒胸臆而作结，但上句的“归有日”又与首联的“辞国”、“望家”遥相呼应。\n此诗起势不凡，有如醍醐灌顶，在读者心上激起冲击浪，浪一重，愁一重，水一曲，肠一曲，几经曲折，最后以绵绵无尽的情意作结，给人以余味无穷之感。\n这首诗感情真挚，以景衬情，情景交融，达到一个较高的境界；章法严谨，对仗工整，音韵和谐，表现出一种自然而又流动的整齐美，是一首成熟的五言律诗，堪称“示后进以准”的佳作。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴岭：指大庾岭，五岭之一，在今江西大余县和广东南雄县交界处，因岭上多梅花，也称梅岭。辞国：离开京城。国：国都，指长安。\n⑵轺（yáo）：只用一马驾辕的轻便马车。\n⑶翥（zhù）：鸟向上飞举。南翥鸟：前人有过三种解释：一说泛指南飞的鸟；一说指鹧鸪，《禽经》上有“鹧鸪南翥”的说法，而古人又认为鹧鸪的叫声是“行不得也哥哥”，自然引起行人的惆怅；又一说是大雁，根据是作者同时的诗作《题大庾岭北驿》有云：“阳月南飞雁，传闻至此回。我行殊未已，何日复归来？”又《唐会要》卷二八有“阳为君德，雁随阳者，臣归君之象也”的说法。\n⑷北枝花：大庾岭北的梅花。《白氏六帖·梅部》称：“大庾岭上梅，南枝落，北枝开。”\n⑸霁：雨（或雪）止天晴。\n⑹长沙：用西汉贾谊故事。谊年少多才，文帝欲擢拔为公卿。因老臣谗害，谊被授长沙王太傅（汉代长沙国，今湖南长沙市一带）。《史记·屈原贾生列传》谓：贾谊“闻长沙卑湿，自以寿不得长，又以谪去。意不自得。”诗意本此。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2017","poet":"唐代
