陈子昂\n正文：秣马临荒甸，登高览旧都。\n犹悲堕泪碣，尚想卧龙图。\n城邑遥分楚，山川半入吴。\n丘陵徒自出，贤圣几凋枯！\n野树苍烟断，津楼晚气孤。\n谁知万里客，怀古正踌蹰。\n分类：登高 怀古 抒情\n文学赏析：岘山，又名岘首山，位于湖北襄阳城南九里，以山川形胜和名人古迹著称。岘山属襄阳治，名城襄阳当汉水之曲，与樊城隔水相望，自古以来就是兵家必争之地。距襄阳县西二十里，为隆中，即卧龙先生草庐对策之地。襄阳故城，即其县治。\n陈子昂登临岘山，不觉发思古之幽情，写下这首怀古诗。\n开头二句说“秣马临荒甸，登高览旧都。”外城为郭，郭外为郊，郊外为甸，秣马于荒甸，说明岘山在襄阳郊外。公元208年（建安十三年），曹操平荆州，立襄阳郡，自此“冠盖相望，一都之会也”。诗人登临岘山，俯瞰襄阳，不禁想到晋朝的羊祜、三国的诸葛亮。羊祜喜游山，常登岘山，终日不倦，曾对从行者说过：“自有宇宙，便有此山，由来贤达胜士，登此远望，如我与卿者多矣！皆湮灭无闻，使人悲伤，如百岁后有知，魂魄犹应登此也。”羊祜为太守，清名远扬，很受百姓的爱戴，且有献策平吴之功，终身清廉不营私，唯对岘山的青峰白云流连不已。羊祜病笃，荐杜预自代，年五十八卒。襄阳百姓在岘山、羊祜平生游憩之所，建碑立庙以纪念，望其碑者，无不流涕。杜预死后为碑起名曰“堕泪碑”，就是陈子昂诗中所说的“堕泪碣”。\n曹操伐刘表时，表已卒，刘备屯兵樊城，闻讯赴襄阳，曹操即派精锐紧紧追击，刘备兵溃于当阳、长坂；诸葛受命于危难之间，东结孙吴，共御曹魏。赤壁之战，奠定鼎足之势，功盖三分，名成八阵，登临岘山，俯见襄樊，不能不缅怀以南阳布衣而名垂环宇的诸葛武侯。\n“犹悲”、“尚想”，点明“怀古”，也抒发诗人斯人虽逝，而凭吊弥深的感情。\n以下接诸葛功业回顾三国时代，古之楚地，魏、蜀、吴，各个分据；汉水入江处在夏口，夏口城为孙权所筑。《尚书禹贡》谓：“汉水南至大别入江。”大别山，《元和志》谓指汉阳县东北之鲁山，“南枕蜀江，北带汉水”，孙吴据长江天险，因此诗中说：“城邑遥分楚，山川半入吴。”“遥”既表现楚地辽阔，又表现事已久远，兼指时空。“山川”句，诗人于岘山之上，思绪万千，见汉水曲流岘山之东，而想到滔滔东去的景象。\n三、四句诗人怀想羊祜、诸葛，五、六两句则转谈三国事，并非仅就山川而言，其间包涵了“人谋胜天险”的寓意。羊祜献平吴之策，晋灭东吴诸葛用联吴之策，以抗曹魏；刘备因意气用事，败于夷陵；孙皓以残暴多疑，终致亡国。面对四百多年前的历史遗迹，诗人不禁发出慨叹。\n岘山之南，有后汉襄阳侯习郁故居。习郁在此引水作养鱼池，筑以高堤，间种楸、竹。秋来，楸丝垂垂，修竹亭亭，景致怡人。晋朝时的征南将军山简，都督荆、湘、交、广四州，镇守于襄阳，每过习郁园池，必痛饮至大醉方归。常说：“此我高阳池。”\n刘景升治襄阳时，筑景升台，常登层台之上歌《野鹰来》曲，死后，葬襄阳城东门外二百步。杜甫十三世祖、镇南大将军，杜预，字元凯，曾在襄阳兴水利，百姓称之为“杜父”。元凯作两碑，一碑沉万山山下潭水中；另一沉岘山山下水中，碑文述己之功业。元凯沉碑时说：“百年之后，何知不深谷为陵也。”陈子在此即借杜元凯沉碑事，并引申其意，即使百年之后，深谷突起为丘陵，亦是徒然。空有丘陵出，无数英雄豪杰、古圣先贤，都已经凋零作古了。\n“野树苍烟断，津楼晚气孤。”沔水经过习郁的邑城，出安昌县东北大父山，西南流，注于白水，南面有汉光武故宅，后汉人苏伯阿曾在此“望气”，称白水乡光武宅有郁郁葱葱的兴旺佳气。陈子昂借此慨叹郁郁葱葱之气已经中断消失了。“苍烟断”、“晚气孤”，诗人借景抒怀，表达他对时政的忧心焦虑。\n“谁知万里客，怀古正踌蹰。”诗人来自蜀山之中，所以自称“万里客”，“谁知”，表现了诗人孤寂落寞的心境，“踌蹰”，指惆怅而徘徊。当诗人凭吊遗踪的时候，缅怀治世良材，有为的将帅以及像羊祜、诸葛亮那样永远为百姓思念的贤臣良相，更希望这样的贤圣，代代不绝。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴岘山：又名岘首山，位于湖北襄阳城南九里，以山川形胜和名人古迹著称。\n⑵秣马：喂马，放马。临：临近。这里是来到之意。荒甸：郊远。\n⑶旧都：指古襄阳城。岘山属襄阳治，名城襄阳当汉水之曲，与樊城隔水相望，自古以来就是兵家必争之地。距襄阳县西二十里，为隆中，即卧龙先生草庐对策之地。襄阳故城，即其县治。\n⑷堕泪碣；即岘山上的羊祜碑（碑为方形，碣为圆形。这里即指碑）。\n⑸卧龙图：指诸葛亮的谋略。应专指《隆中对》。\n⑹“城邑”句：战国时襄阳为秦、楚交界之处，故云“城邑遥分楚。”\n⑺“山川”句：襄阳在汉水之滨，汉水入长江，长汉经楚入吴，以上两句写在岘山所见辽阔境界。\n⑻“丘陵”二句：意思是：丘陵空自高出于平原；而圣贤该有多少已经谢世，二无继起者。慨叹自然的变化和人事的代谢。\n⑼“野树”二句：是说远处荒野林木，被苍茫的雾气遮断了；渡口的楼台在傍晚的烟霭中孤零零地耸立着。\n⑽万里客：离家远行的游子，指作者自...","metadata":{"poem_id":"3304","poet":"唐代
