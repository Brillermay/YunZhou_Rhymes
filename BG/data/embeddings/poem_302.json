佚名\n正文：终南何有？有条有梅。\n君子至止，锦衣狐裘。\n颜如渥丹，其君也哉！\n终南何有？有纪有堂。\n君子至止，黻衣绣裳。\n佩玉将将，寿考不忘！\n分类：诗经 赞美\n创作背景：关于这首诗作者身份的推测，前人有两种说法：其一，秦大夫所作。《毛诗序》以为“（襄公）能取周地，始为诸侯，受显服，大夫美之故作是诗，以戒劝之”。其二，周遗民所作。方玉润《诗经原始》云：“此必周之耆旧，初见秦君抚有西土，皆膺天子命以治其民，而无如何，于是作此。”其最有力的推断即是“其君也哉”一句。严粲《诗缉》云：“‘其’者，将然之辞。‘哉’者，疑而未定之意。”此句意为：“这个人将成为我们的君主吗？”方玉润说：“秦臣颂君，何至作疑而未定之辞，曰‘其君也哉’，此必不然之事也。”现代有的研究者认为是终南山的姑娘，对进山的青年表示爱慕之心而作。\n《史记·秦本纪》：“（周）平王封襄公为诸侯，赐之歧以西之地。其子文公，遂收周遗民有之。”诗大约就作于秦襄公立国时期。\n文学赏析：关于这首诗作者身份的推测，前人有两种说法：其一，秦大夫所作。《诗序》以为“（襄公）能取周地，始为诸侯，受显服，大夫美之故作是诗，以戒劝之”。其二，周遗民所作。方玉润《诗经原始》云：“此必周之耆旧，初见秦君抚有西土，皆膺天子命以治其民，而无如何，于是作此。”其最有力的推断即是“其君也哉”一句。严粲《诗缉》云：“‘其’者，将然之辞。‘哉’者，疑而未定之意。”此句意为：“这个人将成为我们的君主吗？”方玉润说：“秦臣颂君，何至作疑而未定之辞，曰‘其君也哉’，此必不然之事也。”理由较充足，可信为周遗民之作。现代有的研究者认为是终南山的姑娘，对进山的青年表示爱慕之心而作，亦别开生面，可备参考。　又关于此诗究竟是“美”还是“戒”，前人亦意见不一。朱熹《诗集传》主“此秦人美其君之词”，姚际恒亦肯定“有美无戒”。而《诗序》的总体评价是：“《终南》，戒襄公也。”方玉润则以为此诗“美中寓戒，非专颂祷”。从诗的实际情况来看，方氏所见较为平允。\n诗的“美”，最主要是赞颂秦公的容颜、服饰和仪态。两章诗都对“君子”的来到表示出敬仰和赞叹的态度。那君子的脸红润丰泽，大有福相。那诸侯的礼服，内里狐白裘，外罩织锦衣，还有青白相间斧形上装和五次斑斓的下裳，无不显得精美华贵，熠熠生辉。诗中对秦公的衣着有着一种新鲜感，不像是司空见惯习以为常的感觉，秦公也像是在炫耀华服似的，在在证明这确是秦襄公被始封为诸侯而穿上显服的情景。《史记·秦本纪》：“（周）平王封襄公为诸侯，赐之歧以西之地。其子文公，遂收周遗民有之。”诗大约就作于那时期。除了服装外，诗还写到了饰物的佩声锵锵，那身上琳琅的美玉挂件叮当作响，音韵悦耳。这就见出诗所描摹的形象是动态的，行进中的，仿佛让人感觉到秦公步履雍容来到终南山祭祀行礼。诗通过视觉、听觉形象的勾勒，至少在外观上透出富贵气派和令人敬仰感。\n至于作者所代表的周遗民的内心感受是怎样的，似乎不像外在敬意那样简单，两章末尾各有一句耐人寻味的结语。第一句是“其君也哉”，从那惊疑不定的揣测口吻中，显出忐忑不安忧喜参半的复杂心情。新君降临一方，旧地遗民自有前途未卜的紧张心理，这很真实自然。第二句是“寿考不忘”，意谓：秦君哪，你富贵寿考，但最终不要忘记这里曾是周王的土地和百姓呵！将祝福、叮咛、告诫、期望种种难以直言的心境委婉托出。辨味这两句，诗确实是意存劝戒，希望秦君是明君，而不是暴君。至于为什么那么含蓄婉曲，汪中《述学·释三九》说：“周人尚文，君子之于言不径而致也，是以有曲焉。”倒是较为圆通的。不过，最主要的恐怕还是不便直说。\n最后看看两章诗的起兴有何意味。首先，周民搬出引以为豪的周地名山起兴，显示了王都之民的身分和某种程度的优越感，也可使初来乍到的秦公不至小觑他们。就此意义而言，或有借当地名胜以壮胆撑门面的虚荣心理吧。其次，更为重要的是，终南山又名中南山，巍峨险峻，为万众仰慕。《尚书·禹贡》：“终南悖物。”《左传·昭公四年》：“荆山、中南，九州之险。”皆指此山。终南山有丰富的物产，尤以根深叶茂的林木为代表。还有宽衍险奥气象万千的山势。这些表面物象，明眼人都不难看清。那么作者何以要如数家珍不惜饶舌呢？一层意思是以隆崇的终南山，暗寓对秦公尊严身分的褒扬，有以伟物兴伟人的奉承之意。另一层意思是让秦公好好思忖一下：你真的能像终南山一样的受人尊崇吗？你只有修德爱民，不负众望，才能与名山的地位相媲美。正如后世曹操《短歌行》诗所云：“山不厌高，水不厌深。周公吐哺，天下归心。”其寓戒于颂一石两鸟的用意非常含蓄巧妙。\n而另一解，诗只是对主君的赞扬。纵观秦风各部与其他各师不同不是大多言色，如果按本诗前文到最后的意思承接来看只是对秦君的赞扬，参照朱熹《诗集传》主“此秦人美其君之词”，姚际恒亦肯定“有美无戒”，可以解释为第二种。\n现代译文：\n\n终南山上有什么？有棱有角地宽敞。有位君子到此地，青黑上衣五彩裳。身上佩玉响叮当，富贵...","metadata":{"poem_id":"302","poet":"先秦
