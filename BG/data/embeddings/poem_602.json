佚名\n正文：既破我斧，又缺我斨。\n周公东征，四国是皇。\n哀我人斯，亦孔之将。\n既破我斧，又缺我锜。\n周公东征，四国是吪。\n哀我人斯，亦孔之嘉。\n既破我斧，又缺我銶。\n周公东征，四国是遒。\n哀我人斯，亦孔之休。\n分类：诗经 赞美\n文学赏析：此诗共三章，采用复沓形式，各章仅异数字。孔颖达疏曰：“三章上二句恶四国，下四句美周公。”\n第一章前两句以“既破”、“又缺”起始，斧、斨均为生产工具，人们赖以创造财富、维持生计。然这些工具均因为四国之君长年累月服劳役而致破致缺，家计亦因此而处于困苦之中，故尔怨恨深深。这里是以斧斨等工具的破缺来反映劳役之长之苦；以人们赖以生产劳动的必要条件的毁废，来反映生活之困。这是以点代面，以个别代全部，言事而寄慨的手法。\n关于这两句，郑笺另有说法：“既破毁我周公，又损伤我成王，以此二者为大罪。”以斧斨之破缺比作对周公、成王的流言毁谤，这似乎过分拘泥于史事而说得太玄远了。而将周公比斧，成王比斨，恐亦有失礼度。\n人们生活在这么艰难困苦之中，终于有了转机，有了希望：周公率兵东征了。当时周京为镐，在今陕西境内，管蔡等四国在今河南一带，故云“东征”。\n三、四两句是因果关系：由于周公东征，所以四国叛乱者惊惧恐慌。毛传释“皇”为匡，即四国乱政得到纠正，走上正道。亦通。政局有转机，全是周公的功劳，故这两句从国的角度美周公，亦是叙事中含抒情，是间接的赞颂。\n第五句“哀我人斯”，是省略了主语周公。周公对人民如此哀怜体恤，故逼出第六句：这是很崇高很伟大呀！这是人民以自身的感受，从内心发出的歌赞声，是直接的赞颂。\n第二、第三两章，结构与第一章完全相同，仅换几个字。“錡”不论解作凿或锯，“銶”不论解作凿还是独头斧，均为劳动生产的工具，其在诗中的作用亦与第一章的“斨”同。这头两句同样在“恶四国”。下四句亦是“美周公”，仅换几个字。“吪”，化也，即受教育，移风易俗。“遒”，毛传解作固（坚固），郑笺解作敛（聚合）。孔颖达疏协调两说云：“遒训为聚亦坚固之义。”即“使四国之民心坚固也”、“四国之民于是敛聚不流散也”。流散之民回归，家人团聚，万民团结，国家自然强固。\n综观全篇，这第四句的最后一字“皇”、“吪”、“遒”似非信手安排，而是有逐层递进，逐层深入的关系在。“皇”，如解为惊恐，则只是乱政的动摇，还未真正改变；如释为匡正，那也只是治的开始，对人民来说这只是外部条件的变化。而“吪”，受教育、受感化，这是深入到内部的变化。最后的“遒”，团聚、强固，则已结出丰硕的果实了。\n末二句“嘉”、“休”基本同义，亦如第一章，是对周公的德行发自内心的直接赞颂。\n不过对此诗也有不同的理解，例如闻一多、程俊英就认为这是东征士卒庆幸得以生还之作。这样，对诗中一些词的解释也就与上面不同。如第一、二两句的斧、斨、錡、銶均指为武器。第五、六两句的“哀我人斯”的“人”则是指战士。因有的战士已战死沙场，活着的也都离乡背井与家人久不见面，这些都让人哀伤。这样的解释，与传统的“美周公”观点是大相径庭的，但也言之成理，可备一说。\n现代译文：激烈征伐中椭形斧砍坏了，我们的方形斧也砍得缺残。英武的周公率领我们东征，匡正四方之国平息了叛乱。可怜我们这些战后余生人，也是非常命大亏苍天有眼！\n\n⑴豳（bīn）：古都邑名，在今陕西省彬县、旬邑县西南一带。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"602","poet":"先秦
