写马\n文学赏析：此诗重点是写马，通过写马来赞颂鲁国的国君鲁僖公。诗分四章，可能与古代一车四马的驾车制度有关。有人说“《礼》：诸侯六闲，马四种，有良马，有戎马，有田马，有驽马”，“作者因马有四种，故每章各言其一”（孔颖达疏）；也有人说每章各写马的一种品性，第一章是写“马之德”，第二章是写“马之力”，第三章是写“马精神”，第四章是写“马志向”（方玉润《诗经原始》），这却不免让人感到穿凿附会，四章中各种各样毛色的马都有，难道说“骊”一定是良马、“駵”一定是劣马？“彭彭”、“伾伾”、“绎绎”、“祛祛”与“臧”、“才”、“作”、“徂”这些形容词（或动词）也看不出与德、力、精神、志向有特定的对应关系。从结构上看，它每章除了第四、五两句“有……有……”句式各具不同内容外，也就第六句末二字和第七、八两句末一字不同，是典型的重章叠句体式，而各章所更易之字，也不像《国风》中的一些篇章那样相互间有递进或联贯关系，而像《国风》中的另一些篇章那样，联章复沓只是为了取得一唱三叹、余音不绝的歌咏艺术效果。\n从诗的表现手法看，此篇尽管用的是赋法而没有比兴成分，但写来跌宕有致，马的形象既生动传神，对鲁君的颂美也点到即止，没有过分的张扬，一切都温而不火，流畅自然，这在《颂》诗中实不多见。全诗先将直接歌咏的对象群马置于广阔无边的原野这一环境背景，且冠以“駉駉”这一表形态的叠字形容词，这样篇首就鼓荡着一种矫健强悍的气势。接着，“薄言駉者”一句略按，往下介绍马的品种，马的品种繁多正可作“思无疆（期、斁、邪）”一句的注脚，为下文的赞颂作了有效的铺垫。“以车”云云，又以带叠字形容词的句子咏马之善于驾车疾驰，与上文的“駉駉牡马”句相呼应，而句中“马”字不出现，叠字词前后位置不同，又见出章法上的变化。最后，由写马转为赞美鲁君，但赞美鲁君仍紧扣住咏马，结尾一丝不苟。从以上分析可以看出，全篇的脉络很分明，作者的写作技巧很纯熟。不妨说这是现存最早的专咏马的咏物诗，后世咏马之诗大致也是这样从马的形体（这在此篇中主要是通过写马的毛色表现出来）、马的动势、马与人的关系这几方面落笔的。作为咏物诗的雏型，它已显得相当完美。一些读者会有此疑问：这样一首具有《国风》风格的诗，为何不在《国风》中？鲁诗不称《风》而称《颂》，前引孔颖达疏实际上已作了说明，原因是鲁为周公长子伯禽的封国，周室重视周公的功绩，尊鲁若王，天子巡守采诸国之诗以观风，遂不及鲁诗。\n从诗的历史文化意义上说，此篇以牧业的兴盛作为治国有方的一大业绩，反映出那个时代对马政的重视。据文献记载，在周代的“六艺”中，就专门有“御”（驾马车）这一艺，周穆王也有驾八骏遨游天下四方的传说。春秋中期，车战仍是战争的主要手段，一辆兵车需四匹马牵引，因此国家军事力量的强弱，必然与马匹数量密切相关，大国号称“千乘之国”，良有以也。“国之大事，在祀与戎”（《左传·成公十三年》），马政于是成为军国要务，各国诸侯都十分重视养马，这在《诗经》中也有所反映，如《鄘风·定之方中》就赞扬卫文公“秉心塞渊，騋牝三千”，而《鲁颂》更是篇篇写到马，《鲁颂·駉》自不待言，《鲁颂·有駜》则诗题就是马肥壮之貌，《鲁颂·泮水》有“其马蹻蹻”句、《鲁颂·閟宫》有“公车千乘”句。在此篇中，写到不同毛色的马的品种有十六种之多，可见驯马养马这一业的发达。而考之典籍，以毛色定名的马还远不止这些。语言学家们认为：某一民族语言中哪一属类事物的名词特别多，就反映出此民族在该方面的知识特别丰富，与该类名词有关的科学技术特别发达。中国上古时期牲畜命名的多样化，正反映了畜牧业的高度发达，这也是中华民族可以为之骄傲的事。\n现代译文：群马高大又健壮，放牧广阔原野上。说起那些雄健马，毛带白色有驈皇，毛色相杂有骊黄，驾起车来奔前方。跑起路来远又长，马儿骏美多肥壮。\n\n⑴駉（jiōng）駉：马健壮貌。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2083","poet":"先秦
