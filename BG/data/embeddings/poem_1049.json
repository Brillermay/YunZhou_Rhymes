佚名\n正文：劝君莫惜金缕衣，劝君惜取少年时。\n(惜取 一作：须取)\n花开堪折直须折，莫待无花空折枝。\n(花开 一作：有花)\n分类：唐诗三百首 励志 惜时\n创作背景：这是中唐时的一首流行歌词。据说元和时镇海节度使李锜酷爱此词，常命侍妾杜秋娘在酒宴上演唱（见杜牧《杜秋娘诗》及自注）。歌词的作者已不可考。有的唐诗选本径题为杜秋娘作或李锜作，是不确切的。\n文学赏析：此诗含意很单纯，可以用“莫负好时光”一言以蔽之。这原是一种人所共有的思想感情。可是，它使得读者感到其情感虽单纯却强烈，能长久在人心中缭绕，有一种不可思议的魅力。它每个诗句似乎都在重复那单一的意思“莫负好时光！”而每句又都寓有微妙变化，重复而不单调，回环而有缓急，形成优美的旋律，反复咏叹强调爱惜时光，莫要错过青春年华。从字面看，是对青春和爱情的大胆歌唱，是热情奔放的坦诚流露。然而字面背后，仍然是“爱惜时光”的主旨。因此，若作“行乐及时”的宗旨看似乎低了，作“珍惜时光”看，便摇曳多姿，耐人寻味。\n一、二句式相同，都以“劝君”开始，“惜”字也两次出现，这是二句重复的因素。但第一句说的是“劝君莫惜”，二句说的是“劝君须惜”，“莫”与“须”意正相反，又形成重复中的变化。这两句诗意又是贯通的。“金缕衣”是华丽贵重之物，却“劝君莫惜”，可见还有远比它更为珍贵的东西，这就是“劝君须惜”的“少年时”了。至于其原因，诗句未直说，那本是不言而喻的：“一寸光阴一寸金，寸金难买寸光阴”，贵如黄金也有再得的时候，“千金散尽还复来”；然而青春对任何人也只有一次，它一旦逝去是永不复返的。可是，世人多惑于此，爱金如命、虚掷光阴的真不少呢。一再“劝君”，用对白语气，致意殷勤，有很浓的歌味，和娓娓动人的风韵。两句一否定，一肯定，否定前者乃是为肯定后者，似分实合，构成诗中第一次反复和咏叹，其旋律节奏是纡回徐缓的。\n三、四句则构成第二次反复和咏叹，单就诗意看，与一、二句差不多，还是“莫负好时光”那个意思。这样，除了句与句之间的反复，又有上联与下联之间的较大的回旋反复。但两联表现手法就不一样，上联直抒胸臆，是赋法；下联却用了譬喻方式，是比义。于是重复中仍有变化。三、四没有一、二那样整饬的句式，但意义上彼此是对称得铢两悉称的。上句说“有花”应怎样，下句说“无花”会怎样；上句说“须”怎样，下句说“莫”怎样，也有肯定否定的对立。二句意义又紧紧关联：“有花堪折直须折”是从正面说“行乐须及春”意，“莫待无花空折枝”是从反面说“行乐须及春”意，似分实合，反复倾诉同一情愫，是“劝君”的继续，但语调节奏由徐缓变得峻急、热烈。“堪折——直须折”这句中节奏短促，力度极强，“直须”比前面的“须”更加强调。这是对青春与欢爱的放胆歌唱。这里的热情奔放，不但真率、大胆，而且形象、优美。“花”字两见，“折”字竟三见；“须——莫”云云与上联“莫——须”云云，又自然构成回文式的复叠美。这一系列天然工妙的字与字的反复、句与句的反复、联与联的反复，使诗句琅琅上口，语语可歌。除了形式美，其情绪由徐缓的回环到热烈的动荡，又构成此诗内在的韵律，诵读起来就更使人感到回肠荡气了。\n有一种歌词，简单到一句两话，经高明作曲家配上优美的旋律，反复重唱，尚可获得动人的风韵；而《金缕衣》，起诗意单纯而不单调，有往复，有变化，一中有多，多中有一，作为独立的诗篇一摇曳多姿，更何况它在唐代是配乐演唱，因此而被广泛流唱了。\n此诗另一显著特色在于修辞上的别致新颖。一般情况下 ，旧诗中比兴手法往往合一，用在诗的发端； 而绝句往往先景语后情语。此诗一反惯例，它赋中有兴，先赋后比 ，先情语后景语，殊属别致。“劝君莫惜金缕衣”一句是赋 ，而以物起情，又有兴的作用。 诗的下联是比喻，也是对上句“须惜少年时”诗意的继续生发 。不用“人生几何 ”式直截的感慨，用花来比少年好时光，用折花来比莫负大好青春，既形象又优美，创造出一个意象世界。\n这就是艺术的表现，形象思维。错过青春便会导致无穷悔恨，这种意思，此诗本来可以用但却没有用“老大徒伤悲”一类成语来表达，而紧紧朝着折花的比喻向前走，继而造出“无花空折枝”这样闻所未闻的奇语。没有沾一个悔字恨字，而“空折枝”三字却耐人寻味，富有艺术感染力。\n现代译文：\n\n\n\n\n⑴金缕衣：缀有金线的衣服，比喻荣华富贵。\n⑵须惜：珍惜。\n⑶堪：可以，能够。\n⑷直须：尽管。直：直接，爽快。\n⑸莫待：不要等到。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1049","poet":"唐代
