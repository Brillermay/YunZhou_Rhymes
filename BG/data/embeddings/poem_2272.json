战争\n文学赏析：这是一篇典型的战争诗。诗人以袒露自身与主流意识的背离，宣泄自己对战争的抵触情绪。作品在对人类战争本相的透视中，呼唤的是对个体生命具体存在的尊重和生活细节幸福的获得。这种来自心灵深处真实而朴素的歌唱，是对人之存在的最具人文关 怀的阐释，是先民们为后世的文学作品树立起的一座人性高标。\n《毛诗序》云：“《击鼓》，怨州吁也。”郑笺以《左传·隐公四年》州吁伐郑之事实之。姚际恒《诗经通论》以为“与经不合者六”，此实乃《春秋·宣公十二年》“宋师伐陈，卫人救陈”之事，在卫穆公时。今以为姚说较《毛序》为合理，姑从姚氏。\n第一章总言卫人救陈，平陈宋之难，叙卫人之怨。结云“我独南行”者，诗本以抒写个人愤懑为主，这是全诗的线索。诗的第三句言“土国城漕”者，《鄘风·定之方中》毛诗序云：“卫为狄所灭，东徙渡河，野居漕邑，齐桓公攘夷狄而封之。文公徙居楚丘，始建城市而营宫室。”文公营楚丘，这就是诗所谓“土国”，到了穆公，又为漕邑筑城，故诗又曰“城漕”。“土国城漕”虽然也是劳役，犹在国境以内，南行救陈，其艰苦就更甚了。\n第二章“从孙子仲，平陈与宋”，承“我独南行”为说。假使南行不久即返，犹之可也。诗之末两句云“不我以归，忧心有忡”，叙事更向前推进，如芭蕉剥心，使人酸鼻。\n第三章写安家失马，似乎是题外插曲，其实文心最细。《庄子》说：“犹系马而驰也。”好马是不受羁束、爱驰骋的；征人是不愿久役、想归家的。这个细节，真写得映带人情。毛传解释一二句为：“有不还者，有亡其马者。”把“爰”解释为“或”，作为代词，则两句通叙营中他人。其实全诗皆抒诗人一己之情，所以四、五两章文情哀苦，更为动人。\n第四章“死生契阔”，毛传以“契阔”为“勤苦”是错误的。黄生《义府》以为“契，合也；阔，离也；与死生对言”是正确的。至于如何解释全章诗义。四句为了把叶韵变成从AABB式，次序有颠倒，前人却未尝言及。今按此章的原意，次序应该是：\n执子之手，与子成说；死生契阔，与子偕老。\n这样诗的韵脚，就成为ABBA式了。本来“死生契阔，与子偕老”，是“成说”的内容，是分手时的信誓。诗为了以“阔”与“说”叶韵，“手”与“老”叶韵，韵脚更为紧凑，诗情更为激烈，所以作者把语句改为这一次序。\n第五章“于嗟阔兮”的“阔”，就是上章“契阔”的“阔”。“不我活兮”的“活”，应该是上章“契阔”的“契”。所以“活”是“佸”的假借，“佸，会也。”“于嗟洵兮”的“洵”，应该是“远”的假借，所以指的是“契阔”的“阔”。“不我信兮”的“信”，应该是“信誓旦旦”的“信誓”，承上章“成说”而言的。两章互相紧扣，一丝不漏。\n“怨”是《击鼓》一诗的总体格调与思想倾向。从正面言，诗人怨战争的降临，怨征役无归期，怨战争中与己息息相关的点滴幸福的缺失，甚至整个生命的丢失。从反面言，诗作在个体心理，行为与集 体要求的不断背离中，在个体生命存在与国家战事的不断抗衡中，在小我的真实幸福对战争的残酷的不断颠覆中，流显出一份从心底而来的厌战情绪。这一腔激烈的厌战之言，要争取的是对个体生命存在的尊重，是生活细节中的切实幸福。\n现代译文：\n击起战鼓咚咚响，士兵踊跃练武忙。有的修路筑城墙，我独从军到南方。\n跟随统领孙子仲，联合盟国陈与宋。不愿让我回卫国，致使我心忧忡忡。\n何处可歇何处停？跑了战马何处寻？一路追踪何处找？不料它已入森林。\n一同生死不分离，我们早已立誓言。让我握住你的手，同生共死上战场。\n只怕你我此分离，没有缘分相会和。只怕你我此分离，无法坚定守信约。\n\n⑴镗：鼓声。其镗，即“镗镗”。\n⑵踊跃：双声连绵词，犹言鼓舞。兵：武器，刀枪之类。\n⑶土国城漕：土：挖土。城：修城。国：指都城。漕：卫国的城市。\n⑷孙子仲：即公孙文仲，字子仲，邶国将领。\n⑸平：平定两国纠纷。谓救陈以调和陈宋关系。陈、宋：诸侯国名。\n⑹不我以归：是不以我归的倒装，有家不让回。\n⑺有忡：忡忡，忧虑不安的样子。\n⑻爰（yuán）：哪里。丧：丧失，此处言跑失。爰居爰处？爰丧其马：哪里可以住，我的马丢在那里。\n⑼于以：在哪里。\n⑽契阔：聚散、离合的意思。契，合；阔，离。\n⑾成说（yuè）：约定、成议、盟约。\n⑿于嗟：叹词。\n⒀活：借为“佸”，相会。\n⒁洵：久远。\n⒂信：守信，守约。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2272","poet":"先秦
