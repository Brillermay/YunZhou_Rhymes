佚名\n正文：萋兮斐兮，成是贝锦。\n彼谮人者，亦已大甚！哆兮侈兮，成是南箕。\n彼谮人者，谁适与谋。\n缉缉翩翩，谋欲谮人。\n慎尔言也，谓尔不信。\n捷捷幡幡，谋欲谮言。\n岂不尔受？既其女迁。\n骄人好好，劳人草草。\n苍天苍天，视彼骄人，矜此劳人。\n彼谮人者，谁适与谋？取彼谮人，投畀豺虎。\n豺虎不食，投畀有北。\n有北不受，投畀有昊！杨园之道，猗于亩丘。\n寺人孟子，作为此诗。\n凡百君子，敬而听之。\n分类：诗经\n文学赏析：造谣之所以有效，乃在于谣言总是披着一层美丽的外衣。恰如英国思想家培根所说：“诗人们把谣言描写成了一个怪物。他们形容它的时候，其措辞一部分是美秀而文雅，一部分是严肃而深沉的。他们说，你看它有多少羽毛；羽毛下有多少只眼睛；它有多少条舌头，多少种声音；它能竖起多少只耳朵来！”古人称造谣诬陷别人为“罗织罪名”，何谓“罗织”，此诗一开始说：“萋兮斐兮，成是贝锦”，就是“罗织”二字最形象的说明。花言巧语，织成的这张贝纹的罗锦，是非常容易迷惑人的，特别是对不长脑壳的国君。\n造谣之可怕，还在于它是背后的动作，是暗箭伤人。当事人无法及时知道，当然也无法一一辩驳。待其知道，为时已晚。诗中二、三、四章，对造谣者的摇唇鼓舌，嘁嘁喳喳，上窜下跳，左右舆论的丑恶嘴脸，作了极形象的勾勒，说他们“哆兮侈兮，成是南箕”、“缉缉翩翩，谋欲谮人”、“捷捷幡幡，谋欲谮言”。作者对之极表愤慨：“彼谮人者，谁适与谋？”正告他们道：“慎尔言也，谓尔不信！”“岂不尔受？既其女迁！”\n造谣之可恨，在于以口舌杀人，杀了人还不犯死罪。作为受害者的诗人，为此对那些谮人发出强烈的诅咒，祈求上苍对他们进行正义的惩罚。诗人不仅投以憎恨，而且投以极大的厌恶：“取彼谮人，投畀豺虎！豺虎不食，投畀有北！有北不受，投畀有昊！”正是所谓“愤怒出诗人”。有人将它与俄国诗人莱蒙托夫《逃亡者》一诗中鄙夷叛徒的诗句“野兽不啃他的骨头，雨水也不洗他的创伤”比较，认为它们都是写天怒人怨，物我同憎的绝妙好辞，都是对那些罪大恶极，不可救药者的无情鞭挞，都是快心露骨之语。\n在诗的结尾处，郑而重之地留下了作诗人的名字，从而使这首诗成为《诗经》中少数有主名的作品之一。这个作法表明，此诗原有极为痛切的本事，是有感而发之作。它应该有一个较详的序文，自叙作者遭遇，然后缀以此诗，自抒激愤之情，可以题为“巷伯诗并序”或“巷伯序并诗”的。也许是后来的选诗者删去或丢失了这序文，仅剩下了抒情的即诗的部分。\n此诗作者孟子，很可能是一位与西汉大史学家司马迁异代同悲的正直人士。东汉班固就曾在《司马迁传赞》里称惨遭宫刑的司马迁是“《小雅·巷伯》之伦”。这个孟子或许也感受过与司马迁同样的心情：“祸莫惨于欲利，悲莫痛于伤心，行莫丑于辱先，诟莫大于官刑。刑馀之人，无所比数，非一也，所从来远矣。”（司马迁《报任少卿书》）无怪乎他是如此痛心疾首，无怪乎诗中对诬陷者是如此切齿愤恨，也无怪乎此诗能引起世世代代蒙冤受屈者极为强烈的共鸣。\n现代译文：各种花纹多鲜明，织成多彩贝纹锦。那个造谣害人者，心肠实在太凶狠！\n\n1.巷伯：掌管宫内之事的宦官。巷，是宫内道名。伯，主管宫内道官之长，即寺人。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1079","poet":"先秦
