佚名\n正文：有杕之杜，其叶湑湑。\n独行踽踽。\n岂无他人？不如我同父。\n嗟行之人，胡不比焉？人无兄弟，胡不佽焉？\n有杕之杜，其叶菁菁。\n独行睘睘。\n岂无他人？不如我同姓。\n嗟行之人，胡不比焉？人无兄弟，胡不佽焉？\n分类：诗经 写人 伤怀\n文学赏析：印度电影《流浪者》中有一首著名插曲《拉兹之歌》，流浪汉拉兹穿街走巷，举目无亲，哀伤地唱道：“到处流浪，到处流浪。我和任何人都没来往，我看这世界像沙漠。……”那种凄凉，那种幽咽，博得人们洒下一掬同情泪。而当读者读到《诗经·唐风》中的《杕杜》时，心情同样很沉重，因为它也是一首流浪者之歌。当然，它比《拉兹之歌》古老得多。\n全诗二章，章九句，复沓章法，二章内容除用韵换字外基本相同。起首“有杕之杜，其叶滑湑”，用孤孤单单的一株赤棠树起兴，与同样是孤孤单单的一株赤棠树起兴，与同样是孤孤单单的流浪汉相对照，既相映成趣，又相对生愁。赤棠虽孤单，还有繁茂树叶作伴，自己却是“光杆司令”一个，相比之下树要比人幸运得多。所以这“兴”又是“反兴”。诗人看到孤树，伫足留连，忽而觉得同病相怜，忽而叹人不如树，感触纷纭。这种独特心理感受与流浪者身份相切合，很有典型意义。关于这流浪者的性别，闻一多《风诗类钞》另有妙诠：“杕杜喻女之未嫁者。《说文》：‘牡曰棠，牝曰杜。’”那末这流浪者竟是一位未婚少女，那就更显悲哀了。此说可备参考。\n起首二句，也可谓“兴而赋也”。第三句“独行踽踽”才是全章的灵魂。整首诗就是描写一个“寻寻觅觅，冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”的踽踽独行者的苦闷叹息。此句独立锁住，不加铺叙，以少驭多，浓缩了许多颠沛流离的苦境，给人无限想像空间。此句点出了流浪者，成为前后内容的分水岭，前是流浪者所见，后是流浪者所思。\n“岂无他人，不如我同父。”路上风尘仆仆的行人还是有的，但心为形役，各有各沉重的精神枷锁与自顾不暇的物质烦恼，没有人肯去对一个陌路人相濡以沫。这时，流浪者想到了同胞手足的兄弟亲情，是“他人”无法比拟和替代的。正如《小雅·常棣》所说：“凡今之人，莫如兄弟。”兄弟，亲人，家园，不知在何方。异域他乡的流浪者在世态炎凉、人情冷暖的现实中想得很多很多，只能在想像中求得一些慰藉。正如安徒生童话《卖火柴的小女孩》，那小女孩孤苦伶仃，只能划火柴在光亮中幻想着已上天国的奶奶来呵护自己，心灵感到一丝温暖。兄弟虽好，毕竟在虚无缥缈中，现实终究是现实，诗人不禁“嗟——”，发出一声长长的叹息。这“嗟”字直贯最末副歌式复唱四句。\n叹息的内容很平实浅近，也正是流浪者的最基本需要：行人为什么不来亲近我？我没有兄弟在旁，为什么不来帮助我？孤独寂寞，呼天抢地，两个激问中蕴藏着浓重的绝望和忧伤。落难的人犹如落水的人，非常需要救援，可没有人会来、没有人能来济助他。这确实是一声令人心寒的长叹。\n由此推想，这首诗创作的时代背景，或是战乱，或是饥荒。《小雅·常棣》说：“丧乱既平，既安且宁。虽有兄弟，不如友生。”（死丧祸乱既平清，一家生活也安宁。那时虽有亲兄弟，反觉不如朋友亲）可作反证。是战争使骨肉离散，沦为难民。又《大雅·召旻》：“瘨我饥馑，民卒流亡。”（饥馑遍地灾情重，十室九空尽流亡）是灾荒使百姓失所，乞食四方。不管哪种情况，这首抒写心灵感受的流浪者之歌，通过一个人的命运，向后世真实展示了一幅古代难民的流亡图，其艺术视角很独特，给人启迪。\n旧说如《毛诗序》谓“《杕杜》，刺时也。君不能亲其宗族，骨肉离散，独居而无兄弟，将为沃所并尔”，为今人所不取；而朱熹《诗集传》谓此为“无兄弟者自伤其孤特而求助于人之辞”，则差为近之。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"180","poet":"先秦
