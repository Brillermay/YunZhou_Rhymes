佚名\n正文：四月维夏，六月徂署。\n先祖匪人，胡宁忍予？秋日凄凄，百卉具腓。\n乱离瘼矣，爰其适归？冬日烈烈，飘风发发。\n民莫不穀，我独何害？山有嘉卉，侯栗侯梅。\n废为残贼，莫知其尤！相彼泉水，载清载浊。\n我日构祸，曷云能穀？滔滔江汉，南国之纪。\n尽瘁以仕，宁莫我有？匪鹑匪鸢，翰飞戾天。\n匪鳣匪鲔，潜逃于渊。\n山有蕨薇，隰有杞桋。\n君子作歌，维以告哀。\n分类：诗经 迁谪\n文学赏析：此诗抒发了诗人构祸南谪的痛伤之情。作者自称君子，诗中愤愤不平地诉说自己曾为国事操尽了心，并以“南国之纪”的江汉，比喻自己曾是国家的重要角色。可是如今却被放逐江南，受着无穷的灾难。因此他恨自己不是鸟不是鱼，不然就可以上天入渊，逃之夭夭了。在这无可奈何中，他只得以诗来寄托自己的悲哀。从诗中“卒章显志”的末两句“君子作歌，维以告哀”来看，诗中抒发了强烈的悲愤之情。后世屈原《九章·惜诵》：“惜诵以致愍兮，发愤以抒情。”其情实与此诗一脉相通。那么，诗人为什么要“告哀”，告什么哀，这可从前面七章找答案。\n前三章是“哀”的内容。二章的“乱离瘼矣，爰其适归”是哀的集中表现，诗人颠沛流离，遭贬谪，被窜逐，无家可归，贫病交加，仓皇狼狈，犹如丧家之犬。\n流亡或流放的本身已够悲惨，而主观心境与客观环境更加深了这种悲哀的程度。从首章“先祖匪人，胡宁忍予？”呼天抢地声中，可见诗人怨愤之深。他不是平民，更不是拾荒流浪汉，而是勋戚贵族的后裔。他说：现 在遭受莫大苦难，先祖在天之灵怎会忍心看我受罪而不加荫庇？逝世的先人当然无辜，诗人的用意自然是指斥活着的当道者刻薄寡恩，对功臣后裔尚且未加眷顾，更何况他人。对照屈原《离骚》的首句：“帝高阳之苗裔兮（我是古帝高阳氏的后裔）。”用自己先祖的高贵，表示对楚怀王流放、迫害自己的不满，两者用意如出一辙。\n在客观环境上，一是写经历时间之长，从“四月维夏”到“冬日烈烈”，整整三个季度。从京城流放到目的地，需长途跋涉九个月，道途之凄怆艰辛，流放地的僻远蛮荒可想而知。二是写各季的自然环境，四月到六月是炎蒸伏天，酷热溽暑尽在不言中。“徂暑”，好不容易熬过了暑天，盼望能熬出头，却不知路还远着呢！接着是秋天，“百卉俱腓”，一派萧瑟恻怆景象；再接着是冬天，“飘风发发”，狂风怒吼，严寒凛冽。人们蜷缩在家里，或围炉取暖，或饮酒作乐，他却要在天寒地冻刺骨寒风中跋涉前进，那真是够悲哀的。用心境、环境烘托和加深对“哀”的表现，这种艺术手法运用得很成功。顺便说一句，诗的第三章与《小雅·蓼莪》第五章几乎全同，这种句段互相移用的现象在《诗经》中并不罕见，原因可能是诗在当时非常流行，如同民歌民谣一样被广泛传诵吟唱，因而其中某些切景切情的句段会不期而然地被撷取移用，天衣无缝，如同己出。\n后四章是“哀”的原由。前面三章给人迁徙动荡之感，四章起季节与地域都已相对静止，着重抒发诗人的心理活动，这是一种痛定思痛的反思。四章点出莫名其妙地受谗毁中伤，方玉润《诗经原始》说此章“获罪之冤，实为残贼人所挤。‘废’字乃全篇眼目。”因为“废”，哀才接踵而至。五章追思遭“废”的缘故，当是不肯同流合污吧。泉水有清有浊，自己不能和光同尘，所以一天天遭祸、倒霉。屈原有一篇《渔父》，写他志尚高洁不同流俗而遭放逐，游于江潭。渔父对他“举世皆浊己独清”的品格进行批评劝导，屈子不为所动，渔父鼓枻而去，唱道：“沧浪之水清兮，可以濯吾缨；沧浪之水浊兮，可以濯吾足。”其意境颇与此章相通。\n诗人在流放地安顿后，在周围漫步，附近有山，山上有栗树梅树，山间还有潺潺流泉，山下则是波浪滔滔的长江、汉水，这就明确点出了放逐的地域在南国。长江汉水有条不紊地容纳统领着南方诸水系，而朝廷却纲纪弛败，忠奸莫辨，鞠躬尽瘁却不被信任重用。五章表明自己清白无辜，也包含着“虽九死其犹未悔”的决心。后世大诗人杜甫也继承了这种忠君爱国情操，他的《江汉》诗说：“江汉思归客，乾坤一腐儒。”古往今来，这种耿直倔强的“腐儒”真不少。\n七章继续写所见所思。雕鹰振翅在高空中翱翔，鲤和鲔在深水中潜游，它们能避开猎人的矰缴和渔夫的钓钩，全身远祸。诗人见了不禁神往，叹息道：可惜我不能像雕鹰鲤鲔那样，逃避那人间的桎梏与祸害。诗人脱离现实的向往与追求，也正反映了现实的黑暗与残暴。全诗以一己为代表，在暴露现实方面有相当深度与广度，不愧是现实主义的力作。\n这首诗脉络清晰，层次井然。在写法上，大抵前两句言景，后两句抒情，景和情能丝丝入扣，融为一体，把“告哀”的主旨表现得真挚深沉。\n现代译文：人间四月开始初夏好时节，进入六月酷暑炎天就到来。可恨我的先祖不是善良人，怎么竟然忍心让我受祸灾？\n\n1.四月：指夏历（即今农历）四月。下句“六月”同。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1100","poet":"先秦
