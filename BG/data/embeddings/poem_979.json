佚名\n正文：节彼南山，维石岩岩。\n赫赫师尹，民具尔瞻。\n忧心如惔，不敢戏谈。\n国既卒斩，何用不监！节彼南山，有实其猗。\n赫赫师尹，不平谓何。\n天方荐瘥，丧乱弘多。\n民言无嘉，惨莫惩嗟。\n尹氏大师，维周之氐；秉国之钧，四方是维。\n天子是毗，俾民不迷。\n不吊昊天，不宜空我师。\n弗躬弗亲，庶民弗信。\n弗问弗仕，勿罔君子。\n式夷式已，无小人殆。\n琐琐姻亚，则无膴仕。\n昊天不佣，降此鞠訩。\n昊天不惠，降此大戾。\n君子如届，俾民心阕。\n君子如夷，恶怒是违。\n不吊昊天，乱靡有定。\n式月斯生，俾民不宁。\n忧心如酲，谁秉国成？不自为政，卒劳百姓。\n驾彼四牡，四牡项领。\n我瞻四方，蹙蹙靡所骋。\n方茂尔恶，相尔矛矣。\n既夷既怿，如相酬矣。\n昊天不平，我王不宁。\n不惩其心，覆怨其正。\n家父作诵，以究王訩。\n式讹尔心，以畜万邦。\n分类：诗经 写山\n文学赏析：《小雅·节南山》所指责的对象则是幽王及其权臣。前人屡辩诗旨是“刺王”还是“刺尹”，甚为无谓。总因古代君臣名分颇严，论者又往往横亘一“诗可以怨”或一“《小雅》怨诽而不乱”之念于胸中，因之便有不同的“先入为主”之念在作怪。今就诗论诗，直刺师尹，颇为鲜明；而一再怨望“昊天”，又借以指责天子。\n关于师尹，自毛传以来皆解作“大师尹氏”，至王国维始辨析其为二人，即首掌军职的大师和首掌文职的史尹。观《大雅·常武》中大师“整六师”、尹氏及其属“戒师旅”，则大师统军而尹氏监军，对照《小雅·节南山》诗首章，“忧心如惔，不敢戏谈”正合于军国主义背景，偏于责师；而“国既卒斩，何用不监”。乃监察司之失职，偏于斥尹。\n全诗十章，共分三部分。首二章以南山起兴，以象征二权臣。以山之险要象征其权之枢要，又以山之不平联系到二臣秉政不平。结合篇末“昊天不平，我王不宁”的呼应来看，天怒人怨，总由师尹秉政不平使然，故“不平”二字为全篇眼目。只是第二部分却一再将不平（不夷）与不己（不自为政）并提而责难，推思其义，全诗是指斥师尹失政在不能持平（夷），而要持平则又须事必躬亲（己），因而全诗结构是起于夷（平）终于夷（平）而介于己。\n首章点出“不敢戏谈”以致“国既卒斩”；二章点出昊天再降饥疫以致“丧乱弘多”，民众无法存活，从而“不敢戏谈”之高压失控，遂而“民言无嘉”。一章言人祸，二章言天灾，由时间及顺序暗示天灾实人祸所致，人间暴戾上干天怒所致，此即第一部分的要害。\n从第三到第六共四章为第二部分。在上两章铺垫的基础上，三章进一步点明师尹之害人害天，天再施报于人，人民双重遭殃。“诗可以怨”，怨而至天，亦已极矣！\n四、五两章句式排比，结构整齐而又不乏疏宕之美。四章围绕“夷”“己”二字正反展开，既为师尹说法，更为一切秉政者说法，三十二字可铭于座右，可镌于通衢。五章“昊天不佣（融）”“昊天不惠（慧）”二解是“刺”，“君子如届（临、己）”“君子如夷（平）”二解是“美”，也是对师尹说法。两章排比、对比之势，酣畅淋漓，一气呵成，诗人的责怨之情也推到了高潮。\n六章承上启下，由怒转叹。\n统观第二部分四个章节，结构颇为讲究：五、六章既以“昊天不佣”“昊天不惠”和“不吊昊天”以上应第三章的“不吊昊天”，又以“君子如届（临、己）”、“君子如夷”和“谁秉国成（平、夷）”、“不自为政（不己）”以上应第四章的“式夷式已”，可见此部分是以怨天和尤人双向展开而又并拢合承，甚耐玩味。\n第七、八、九、十章为第三部分。变每章八句为四句，于音乐为变奏。于诗情为由怨怒转悲叹。唯七、八两章疑有错简而当易位：前“方茂尔恶”章言师党与尹党既相倾轧又相勾结，以见朝政难革；后“驾彼四牡”章言无奈之下只有往奔四国避乱（或求诸侯勤王），然而四方亦不可往，“蹙蹙靡所骋”。诗人说：既然宗周与四国皆被师尹扰乱，国已不国，今日上干天怒，下危人主，尽管师尹不自责己而反怨怒匡正，我身为大夫，也只有勇作诗“诵”，“以究王讻”，成此一篇檄文，为来者垂诫了！\n现代译文：巍巍的终南山高耸入云端，层层叠叠的山石危立险矗。太史尹氏正得势权位显赫，引得普天下百姓万众瞩目。仁人君子为国政忧心如焚，不敢开玩笑哪来幽默谈吐！国运已经衰落得如此不堪，你为什么还这样熟视无睹！\n\n1.节：通“巀（jié）”。长言之则为巀嶭（niè），亦即嵯峨。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"979","poet":"先秦
