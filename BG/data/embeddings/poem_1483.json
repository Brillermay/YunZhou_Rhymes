写人\n文学赏析：《毛诗序》云：“《下武》，继文也，武王有圣德，复受天命，能昭先人之功焉。”郑笺云：“继文者，继文王之业而成之。”陈奂《诗毛氏传疏》补充说明：“文，文德也。文王以上，世有文德，武王继之，是之谓继文。”宋代自吕祖谦、朱熹以后，释《下武》另有说法，如严粲《诗缉》、戴溪《续吕氏家塾读诗记》，或以为下武乃不尚武，有偃武之意，或以为下武即世修文德，以武为下。清代的经学家解此诗，陈启源《毛诗稽古编》、戴震《诗经补注》、胡承珙《毛诗后笺》等均坚守毛、郑之说，而翁方纲《诗附记》、桂馥《札朴》等则赞同宋儒之说。按验诗歌文本，毛、郑之说不误，“不尚武”、“以武为下”云云，过于迂远，不可信。今人陈子展《诗经直解》说：“此诗如非史臣之笔，则为贺者之辞。”其说出自陆奎勋《陆堂诗学》。陆氏以《尚书》等经文印证此诗，谓“‘下武维周’，犹《长发》之‘濬哲维商’也”，“周公之戒成王者曰‘永言配命，自求多福’，故继言之曰‘永言配命，成王之孚’也”，“‘昭哉嗣服’，即《顾命》所云‘命汝嗣训，临君周邦’也；‘绳其祖武’，即所云‘答扬文武之光训’也；‘四方来贺’，即《康王诰》所云‘诸侯皆布乘黄朱，奉圭兼币’也；‘不遐有佐’即所云‘太保率西方诸侯入应门左，毕公率东方诸侯入应门右’也”。陈氏以为其所析“以经证经”，“不为无据”。\n《大雅·下武》的篇章结构非常整饬严谨，层层递进，有条不紊。第一章先说周朝世代有明主，接着赞颂太王、王季、文王与武王，第二章上二句赞颂武王，下二句赞颂成王，第三章赞颂成王能效法先人，第四、第五章赞颂康王能继承祖德，第六章以四方诸侯来贺作结，将美先王贺今王的主旨发挥得淋漓尽致。在修辞上，此篇特别精于使用顶针辞格，将顶针格的效用发挥到了极致。第一、第二章以“王配于京’’顶针勾连，第二、第三章以“成王之孚”顶针勾连，第五、第六章以“受天之祜”顶针勾连，而第四章的末句“昭哉嗣服”与第五章的首句“昭兹来许”意思相同，结构也相同，可视为准顶针勾连。《大雅》的第一篇《文王》也善于使用顶针修辞，但比起《下武》那样精工的格式，不及远矣。而且此篇以顶针格串联的前三章组成的赞颂先王的述旧意群，与同以顶针格（或准顶针格）串联的后三章组成的赞颂今王的述新意群，又通过第三、第四章各自的第三句“永言孝思”可以上下维系，有如连环。这种刻意经营的巧妙结构，几乎是空前绝后的，其韵律节奏流美谐婉，有效地避免了因庙堂文学歌功颂德文字的刻板而造成的审美负效应，使读者面对这一表现《大雅》《周颂》中常见的歌颂周先王、今王内容的文本，仍能产生一定的审美快感。英国文艺理论家克莱夫·贝尔（Clive Bell）在他的《艺术》一书中提出了“艺术即有意味的形式”这一著名的论断，确实，形式在文学艺术作品中的重要性决不容低估，有时候，形式本身就是美。读完《下武》，读者可能很快就忘了诗中“哲王”“世德”“配命”“顺德”之类赞颂之词，但对它章法结构的形式美则将记忆犹新。\n现代译文：后能继前惟周邦，世代有王都圣明。三位先王灵在天，武王配天居镐京。\n\n⑴下武：在后继承。下，后；武，继承。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1483","poet":"先秦
