战争 赞美 写人\n文学赏析：此诗题目特别，《诗经》大多是取首句语词为题，有的虽不是首句，但亦是诗中的语词，而“常武”一词不见于该诗，故说诗者议论纷纭。《毛诗序》谓其意是“有常德以立武事，因以为戒然”；朱熹《诗序辨说》申此说“盖有二义：有常德以立武则可，以武为常则不可，此所以有美而有戒也”，对此，姚际恒《诗经通论》驳道：“诗中极美王之武功，无戒其黩武意。毛、郑亦无戒王之说，然则作《序》者其腐儒之见明矣。”王质《诗总闻》谓“自南仲以来，累世著武，故曰常武”：方玉润《诗经原始》以为“常武”是乐名，他说：“武王克商，乐曰《大武》，宣王中兴，诗曰《常武》，盖诗即乐也。”近人或以为古常、尚通用，“常武”即尚武，与诗旨正合。\n此诗赞美周宣王率兵亲征徐国，平定叛乱，取得重大的胜利。诗人的叙述基本按照事件的发展：首章写宣王委任将帅并部署战备任务；第二章通过尹氏向程伯休父下达作战计划。这两章着重记述史实，一一交代重要人物，虽然极为简括，但却把形势、任务、目标乃至进军路线都说清楚了。这自然是最高统帅宣王的杰作，诗人以最简洁的笔法，表现了宣王胸有成竹、指挥若定的气魄与指挥才能。\n第三章写进军。诗人先从“我方”着笔：天子亲征，沉稳从容，战士行军，不紧不慢，充满一种胜券在握的坚定信心。而敌方，在诗人笔下则是另一番景象：徐方阵营骚动、震恐，以致如五雷轰顶，仓皇失措。一镇定，一惊慌，两相对照，显示出王师强大的力量，未战已先声夺人。\n第四章写王师进击徐夷。诗人以天怒雷震，比喻周王奋发用武；以猛虎怒吼，比喻官兵勇敢，极力突出王师惊天动地的气势。以此击徐，无异泰山压顶，自然战无不胜，攻无不克。王师迅疾深入淮河腹地，切断了徐淮的联系，还俘获了大批叛军，进而扎营于此，为剿灭敌人作准备。全章八句，前用比，后用赋，寥寥几笔便勾勒出了进军的形势，充分显示出王师的压倒优势。第五章写王师的无比声威。诗人满怀激情，借助精巧选词，串联比喻、排句，饱蘸笔墨，歌唱王师。这是全诗最精彩的部分。\n第六章写王师凯旋，归功天子。诗人先颂扬天子计谋允当，再说胜利是“天子之功”，然后写到王下令“还归”，叙述次第井然。“王曰还归”回应篇首“王命卿士”，一反映今日胜利的踌躇满志；一表现昔日大敌当前的凝重心境，前后鲜明对照，首尾相连，结构完善。此章造句颇奇特，双句、单句“徐方”二字交替使用，方玉润《诗经原始》评曰：“‘徐方’二字回环互用，奇绝快绝！”诗人反覆提出“徐方”，正见出对这次平徐胜利的特别重视与喜悦。徐为淮夷大国，屡与朝廷抗衡，今已降服来朝，自然极为可喜可贺，要津津乐道；同时又是天子亲征，诗人怎能不张大其功，宣扬徐方“既来”、“既同”、“来庭”、“不回”。可见连用四个“徐方”既是内容使然，又是抒情志感的需要，并非故意造奇。\n中国古代叙事诗不很发达，但如《大雅·常武》一诗，尽管在细节的叙述上精详远不及古希腊罗马的史诗，却也神完气足，其叙事虚写与实写的巧妙结合，尤为一大特色，从诗歌艺术上说，即使与古希腊罗马史诗相比，似也不遑多让。\n现代译文：看我大周天子多显赫英武，他任命一位重臣卿士大夫，名将南仲是这重臣的始祖，让皇父担任太师主管军务：你要抓紧整顿我大周军队，要抓紧打造兵器准备动武；我们要深怀恭敬戒惧之心，一定给南方百姓带去幸福。\n\n1.赫赫：威严的样子。明明：明智的样子。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1705","poet":"先秦
