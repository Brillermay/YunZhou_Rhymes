赞美\n创作背景：这是一首祝贺西周奴隶主贵族宫室落成的歌辞。《毛诗序》说：“《斯干》，宣王考室也。”郑笺说：“考，成也。……宣王于是筑宫室群寝，既成而衅之，歌《斯干》之诗以落之，此之谓之成室。”清人陈奂《诗毛氏传疏》说得更清楚。他说：“厉王奔彘，周室大坏，宣王即位，复承文武之业，故云考室焉。”似乎通过歌颂宫室的落成，也歌颂了周宣王的中兴。但是，宫室是否是周宣王时所建，此诗是否是歌颂周宣王，历来的解诗家又有不同的意见。有谓是周武王营镐，有谓是周成王营洛。更有不确指何时者，宋人朱熹《诗集传》就说：“此筑室既成，而燕饮以落之，因歌其事。”清人方玉润《诗经原始》也批驳了周武王、周成王、周宣王诸说，而仅说：“《斯干》，公族考室也。”\n此诗是“衅之”之辞，还是“落之”之歌，或“燕饮”时所唱，各家又争论不休。衅，《说文》云：“血祭也。”就是郑笺所说的“宗庙成则又祭先祖”，是以牲血涂抹宫室而祭祀祖先的一种仪式；“落之”，唐人孔颖达的《毛诗正义》又作“乐之”。落是落成，乐是欢庆，看来是一首庆祝宫室落成典礼时所奏的歌曲的歌辞。当然，举行落成典礼，内有祭祖、血祀的仪轨也是可能的。因此，说这是一首西周奴隶主贵族在举行宫室落成典礼时所唱的歌辞，是没有多大问题的。\n文学赏析：全诗九章，一、六、八、九四章七句，二、三、四、五、七五章五句，句式参差错落，自然活脱，使人没有板滞、臃肿之感，在雅颂篇章中是颇具特色的。\n就诗的内容来看，全诗可分两大部分。一至五章，主要就宫室本身加以描绘和赞美；六至九章，则主要是对宫室主人的祝愿和歌颂。\n第一章先写宫室之形胜和主人兄弟之间的和睦友爱。它面山临水，松竹环抱，形势幽雅，位置优越，再加兄弟们和睦友爱，更是好上加好了。其中，“如竹苞矣，如松茂矣”二句，既赞美了环境的优美，又暗喻了主人的品格高洁，语意双关，内涵深厚，可见作者的艺术用心。接着第二章说明，主人建筑宫室，是由于“似续妣祖”，亦即继承祖先的功业，因而家人居住此处，就会更加快乐无间。言下之意，他们的创举，也会造福于子孙后代。这是理解此诗旨意的关键和纲领，此后各章的诗意，也是基于这种思想意识而生发出来的。以下三章，皆就建筑宫室一事本身描述，或远写，或近写，皆极状宫室之壮美。三章“约之阁阁，椓之橐橐”，既写建筑宫室时艰苦而热闹的劳动场面，又写宫室建筑得是那么坚固、严密。捆扎筑板时，绳索“阁阁”发响；夯实房基时，木杵“橐橐”作声，可谓绘形绘声，生动形象。正因为宫室建筑得坚固而紧密，所以“风雨攸除，鸟鼠攸去”，主人“居、处”自然也就安乐了。四章连用四比喻，极写宫室气势的宏大和形势的壮美，可说是博喻赋形，对宫室外形进行了精雕细刻的描绘，表现了作者的丰富想像力。如果说，四章仅写宫室外形，那么第五章就具体描绘宫室本身的情状了。“殖殖其庭”，室前的庭院那么平整；“有觉其楹”，前厦下的楹柱又那么耸直；“哙哙其正”，正厅是宽敞明亮的；“哕哕其冥”，后室也是光明的。这样的宫室，主人居住其中自然十分舒适安宁。\n由此可见，作者在描绘宫室本身时，是由大略至具体、由远视到近观、由室外到室内，一层深似一层、逐步推进展现的。它先写环境．再写建筑因由，再写建筑情景，再写宫室外形，再写宫室本身，犹如摄影机一样，随着观察点和镜头焦距的推移，而把客观景象有层次、有重点地摄入，使读者对这座宫室有了一个完整而具体的认识。更突出的是，每章都是由物到人，更显示出它人物互映的艺术表现力。\n此诗后四章是对宫室主人的赞美和祝愿。六章先说主人入居此室之后将会寝安梦美。所梦“维熊维罴，维虺维蛇”，既为此章祝祷的中心辞语，又为以下四章铺垫、张本。七章先总写“大人”所占美梦的吉兆，即预示将有贵男贤女降生。八章专说喜得贵男，九章专说幸有贤女，层次井然有序。当然，这些祝辞未免有些阿谀、有些俗气，但对宫室主人说些恭维的吉利话，也是情理中事。\n从第八、九章所述来看，作者男尊女卑的思想是很严重的。生男，“载寝之床，载衣之裳，载弄之璋”，而且预祝他将来为“室家君王”；生女，“载寝之地，载衣之裼，载弄之瓦”，而且只祝愿她将来“无非无仪，唯酒食是议，无父母诒罹”。男尊女卑，对待方式不同，对他们的期望也不一样。这应该是时代风尚和...","metadata":{"poem_id":"957","poet":"先秦
