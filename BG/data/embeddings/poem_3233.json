陈子昂\n正文：龙种生南岳，孤翠郁亭亭。\n峰岭上崇崒，烟雨下微冥。\n夜闻鼯鼠叫，昼聒泉壑声。\n春风正淡荡，白露已清泠。\n哀响激金奏，密色滋玉英。\n岁寒霜雪苦，含彩独青青。\n岂不厌凝冽，羞比春木荣。\n春木有荣歇，此节无凋零。\n始愿与金石，终古保坚贞。\n不意伶伦子，吹之学凤鸣。\n遂偶云和瑟，张乐奏天庭。\n妙曲方千变，箫韶亦九成。\n信蒙雕斫美，常愿事仙灵。\n驱驰翠虬驾，伊郁紫鸾笙。\n结交嬴台女，吟弄升天行。\n携手登白日，远游戏赤城。\n低昂玄鹤舞，断续彩云生。\n永随众仙去，三山游玉京。\n分类：咏物 竹子 抒怀\n文学赏析：这首诗的序文是对东方虬《咏孤桐篇》的评论，也是陈子昂对自己创作体会的总结，是他诗歌创作的理论纲领。陈子昂以汉魏诗歌为高标，痛责晋宋以来的浮靡文风，感叹“风骨”和“兴寄”的失落。令他惊喜的是，东方虬《咏孤桐篇》竟使汉魏诗歌的“风骨”与“兴寄”重新得到复归。他盛赞这篇作品“骨气端翔，音情顿挫，光英朗练，有金石声”，可谓风骨朗健的佳作。陈子昂抑制不住内心的激动，遂挥毫写下《与东方左史虬修竹篇》寄赠给东方虬。可惜，东方虬的《咏孤桐篇》今已失传，但从陈子昂的行文来看，那自然是他诗作的同调，而且，陈子昂用以赠答的《修竹篇》的确也是一篇“风骨”与“兴寄”兼备的作品。\n风骨和兴寄是唐诗两个重要的质素，也是后人评论唐诗的两个重要范畴。陈子昂所倡导的“风骨”虽然借自六朝人的成说，但又有他自己新的内涵，是指旺盛的气势与端直的文词结合在一起所构成的那种昂扬奋发、刚健有力的美学风格。陈子昂所高标的“建安风骨”，恰是六朝浮靡诗风的缺失，因此，这对于扭转六朝以来柔弱、颓靡的文风具有不可低估的意义。尤其对于树立唐诗那种昂扬奋发的气度和风范具有重要的意义。\n陈子昂所标举的“兴寄”也是来源于前人主要是汉人“美刺比兴”的观念，其含义就是指诗歌的比兴寄托。这也的确切中了六朝诗歌工于体物、专有形似的弊端。更值得指出的是，陈子昂“风骨”与“兴寄”并举，对唐诗未来的发展，比如实现由风骨向兴寄的“战略转移”，也埋下了伏笔。\n陈子昂同时的人如卢藏用对陈子昂的意义已经有所认识，他在《右拾遗陈子昂文集序》中，给予陈子昂以极高的评价，认为是“道丧五百年而得陈君”，对其代表作《感遇》诗也给予了充分的肯定。但卢藏用的出发点不是诗歌的美学特质，而是儒家的政教观念，因此与陈子昂在诗歌史上的真正价值，与陈子昂的理论主张对唐诗学的真正意义之间尚存在一定的距离。但是，就总体而言，他的评价是客观的、中肯的，得到了后人的赞同。杜甫盛赞陈子昂“公生扬、马后，名与日月悬”，《新唐书·陈子昂传》肯定他“始变风雅”。当然，也有人对卢藏用的评价提出过质疑，如颜真卿、皎然等。明末胡震亨《唐音癸签》综合各种意见，仍然认为陈子昂“与有唐一代诗，功为大耳”。\n此诗的序文阐述作者倡导“风骨”、“兴寄”的创作主张，因此，此诗向来被视为陈子昂文学思想的实践范例。\n全诗正文共三十六句，可分为两大部分。前一部分写生长于南方的修竹品质纯美，实为自身道德、风节之写照。后一部分写修竹得伶伦赏识而得以加工成乐器，也是诗人屡次上书陈述治国方略之表徵。接着，修竹进而欲“升天行”，则是诗人亟欲施展抱负的愿望之表露。\n第一部分即前十八句，主要介绍修竹的生长环境和优良质地。首二句，形象地概括了这一立意。“南岳”，即著名的五岳之一衡山。品质优良的修竹“龙种”产于此地。名山与物华聚集，一开篇就令人神往不已。“孤翠郁亭亭”，既从形色两方面描绘了修竹优美动人的姿态，也颂扬了它的卓然不群。衡山是万木葱笼的，但是，在诗人看来，它们与修竹相较，却有所逊色，所以特意以“孤翠”二字，以显其精。接下去，诗人分别写了修竹生长的自然条件和品性。“峰岭上崇崒”以下八句，紧承首句，描绘了修竹“生南岳”的情景。上有崇山峻岭，下有涧溪烟雨，突出了处境的幽僻；夜闻鼯叫，昼听泉鸣，渲染了四周的清静；春风舒缓，白露清凉，更衬出了氛围的洁净。正因为生长在这样优越的自然环境，所以修竹的“哀响”如同鸣金奏乐，“密色”仿佛受到了美玉的滋润。“岁寒霜雪苦”以下八句，上承第二句，表现修竹的品性。“含彩独青青”，照应了上文的“孤翠”，突出了修竹虽受严冬霜雪折磨却青绿如故的独特品质。接着，诗人由表及里，以“岂不厌凝冽”的反诘，转为深入析理。并继而以“羞比春木荣”作了解答。春天风和日丽，一切草木皆应时而发，竞相争荣。“羞比”表明了修竹傲岸不群，不趋时争荣，接着诗人通过“有荣歇”与“无凋零”的对比，揭示了修竹不屑与春木争荣的实质，又探本溯源，表现了它的志向：“始愿与金石，终古保坚贞。”说明修竹的本性决定了它有如金石，坚贞不二，永不凋零。这段议论，诗人采用反诘、对比、比拟等手法，寓理于象，笔挟风力，使行文“结言端直”、“意气骏爽”（刘勰《文心雕龙·风骨》），显得尤为刚健有力。\n第二部分即后十八句，写修竹被制成洞箫之后的功用及愿望。相传黄帝派乐官伶伦...","metadata":{"poem_id":"3233","poet":"唐代
