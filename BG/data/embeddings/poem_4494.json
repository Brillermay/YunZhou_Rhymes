佚名\n正文：桃之夭夭，灼灼其华。\n之子于归，宜其室家。\n桃之夭夭，有蕡其实。\n之子于归，宜其家室。\n桃之夭夭，其叶蓁蓁。\n之子于归，宜其家人。\n分类：古诗三百首 诗经 桃花 民谣\n文学赏析：这是一首祝贺年青姑娘出嫁的诗。据《周礼》云：“仲春，令会男女。”周代一般在春光明媚桃花盛开的时候姑娘出嫁，故诗人以桃花起兴，为新娘唱了一首赞歌。旧说如《毛序》等以为与后妃君王有关，为今人所不取。\n全诗分为三章。第一章以鲜艳的桃花比喻新娘的年青娇媚。人们常说：第一个用花比美人的是天才，第二个用花比美人的是庸才，第三个用花比美人的是蠢才。《诗经》是中国第一部诗歌总集，所以说这里是第一个用花来比美人，并不为过。自此以后用花、特别是用桃花来比美人的层出不穷，如魏·阮籍《咏怀·昔日繁华子》：“天天桃李花，灼灼有辉光。”唐·崔护《题都城南庄》：“去年今日此门中，人面桃花相映红。”宋·陈师道《菩萨蛮》词：“玉腕枕香腮，桃花脸上开。”他们皆各有特色，自然不能贬之为庸才、蠢才，但他们无不受到《诗经》这首诗的影响，只不过影响有大小，运用有巧妙而已。这里所写的是鲜嫩的桃花，纷纷绽蕊，而经过打扮的新嫁娘此刻既兴奋又羞涩，两颊飞红，真有人面桃花，两相辉映的韵味。诗中既写景又写人，情景交融，烘托了一股欢乐热烈的气氛。这种场面，即使在今天还能在农村的婚礼上看到。第二章则是表示对婚后的祝愿。桃花开后，自然结果。诗人说它的果子结得又肥又大，此乃象征着新娘早生贵子，养个白白胖胖的娃娃。第三章以桃叶的茂盛祝愿新娘家庭的兴旺发达。以桃树枝头的累累硕果和桃树枝叶的茂密成荫，来象征新嫁娘婚后生活的美满幸福，真是最美的比喻，最好的颂辞。朱熹《诗集传》认为每一章都是用的“兴”，固然有理，然细玩诗意，确是兴中有比，比兴兼用。全诗三章，每章都先以桃起兴，继以花、果、叶兼作比喻，极有层次：由花开到结果，再由果落到叶盛；所喻诗意也渐次变化，与桃花的生长相适应，自然浑成，融为一体。\n诗人在歌咏桃花之后，更以当时的口语，道出贺辞。第一章云：“之子于归，宜其室家。”也就是说这位姑娘要出嫁，和和美美成个家。第二、三章因为押韵关系，改为“家室”和“家人”，其实含义很少区别。古礼男以女为室，女以男为家，男女结合才组成家庭。女子出嫁，是组成家庭的开始。朱熹《诗集传》释云：“宜者，和顺之意。室谓夫妇所居，家谓一门之内。”实际上是说新婚夫妇的小家为室，而与父母等共处为家。今以现代语释为家庭，更易为一般读者所了解。\n此篇语言极为优美，又极为精炼。不仅巧妙地将“室家”变化为各种倒文和同义词，而且反覆用一“宜”字。一个“宜”字，揭示了新嫁娘与家人和睦相处的美好品德，也写出了她的美好品德给新建的家庭注入新鲜的血液，带来和谐欢乐的气氛。这个“宜”字，掷地有声，简直没有一个字可以代替。\n对《国风·周南·桃夭》一诗的主旨，也有人提出了新的说法，认为这首诗是先民进行驱鬼祭祀时的唱词，其内容是驱赶鬼神，使之回到归处，并祈求它赐福人间亲人。\n现代译文：桃花怒放千万朵，色彩鲜艳红似火。这位姑娘要出嫁，喜气洋洋归夫家。\n\n⑴夭夭：花朵怒放，美丽而繁华的样子。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"4494","poet":"先秦
