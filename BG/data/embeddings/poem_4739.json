佚名\n正文：山有扶苏，隰有荷华。\n不见子都，乃见狂且。\n山有乔松，隰有游龙，不见子充，乃见狡童。\n分类：诗经 爱情\n创作背景：《毛诗序》以为：“《山有扶苏》，刺忽也，所美非美也，”也就是说，这首诗可以看作是对齐女文姜的讽刺之诗，齐僖公一心想将二女儿文姜嫁于郑昭公忽（郑庄公之子）曾三次向郑昭公忽提亲，郑昭公三次拒绝，使文姜因此而郁郁寡欢而成疾。所以诗文指出，没见到这个美男子却见到了气势猛烈之人，没见到这个美男子却见到一个狡猾的顽童，所以郑昭公忽才不愿意娶文姜为妻，文姜就没有嫁给郑昭公。\n另一种说法是，此诗并非为讽刺郑昭公而作，“郑风”在历史上被当作“靡靡之音”的代名词，当时郑国男女的交往是比较开放和自由的。诗中的“狂且”、“狡童”并不是真实意义的讽刺，而是一种开玩笑式的嬉闹。袁梅《诗经译注》“这是一位女子与爱人欢会时，向对方唱出的戏谑嘲笑的短歌”。崔述《读风偶识》：“昭公为君，未闻有大失道之事。君弱臣强，权臣擅命，虽诚有之，然皆用自庄公之世权重难移，非己之过。厉公欲去祭仲，遂为所逐。文公欲去高克而不能，乃使将兵于河上而不召。为昭公者，岂能一旦而易置之？此固不得以为昭公罪也。如果郑人妄加毁刺，至目君为狡童，悖礼伤教，莫斯为甚。”以为此诗是讥刺郑昭公忽的，就有失牵强。\n文学赏析：全诗共二章，均借草木以起兴。“山有扶苏， 隰有荷华“；”山有乔松，隰有游龙“，描写的尽是山中的树，低谷的花，并未见一人。其实这并不是情侣约会的地点和景色的描写，因为在《诗经》中，“山有…...，隰有......”是常用的起兴句式，如《邶风·简兮》‘中有：“山有榛，隰有苓”，《唐风·山有枢》中有“山有枢，隰有榆”，“山有漆，隰有栗”等。这里就是一个典型的起兴，清代方玉润在《诗经原始》中说：“诗非兴会不能作，或因物以起兴，或因时而感兴，皆兴也”，即这里的兴只从语势或韵脚上引出下文，使诗篇的开头委婉含蓄，与后文的故事并不相关。\n“不见子都，乃见狂且”，这两句是赋，为女子的调笑之辞。“至于子都，天下莫不知其姣也”（《孟子·告子上》）。“子都”，似为传说中古代美男子名，这里泛指俊美的男子。有论者认为“都“姝”古本双声，都”为“姝”的假借。《说文解字》云：“姝，美也”，故子都就是子美。女子称所爱为“狂且”，与美男子“子都”对举，明明是双方相约而来，偏说对方非己所爱，心爱叫冤家，可见其性格的爽朗善谑。\n第二章是叠章，开头两句仍以草木起兴引起下文。“不见子充，乃见狡童”反复调侃，加强语势，感情也层层递进。“子充”泛指美男子。论者认为“充”，古韵在东部，姝”，古韵在区部，区东可以对转，“充”即“姝”的对转，故子充与子都实为同指。始为“子都”，此为“子充”，重章叠句，整饬中有变化，更显得错落有致。\n少女对心上人主动发起调笑戏谑，可以想象，被调侃的男子绝不会甘拜下风，当有回敬。妙语如珠，往来应答，场面应十分热烈，气氛也极为活跃，少男少女率真爽朗的性格及欢快健康的戏剧性场面，在这里得到了淋漓尽致的表现。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"4739","poet":"先秦
