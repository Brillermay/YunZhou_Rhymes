张九龄\n正文：海燕虽微渺，乘春亦暂来。\n岂知泥滓贱，只见玉堂开。\n绣户时双入，华堂日几回。\n无心与物竞，鹰隼莫相猜。\n分类：托物言志\n创作背景：作者是唐玄宗开元（713-741）年间的名相，以直言敢谏著称。由于张九龄屡次顶撞唐玄宗，再加上李林甫从中作梗，玄宗渐渐疏远张九龄。公元736年（开元二十四年），张九龄觉察到皇帝对自己心生不满，终于向李林甫低头，写下这首诗赠与李林甫。然而李林甫并不心慈手软，很快借严挺之事件毁谤张九龄，导致其被罢相。《归燕诗》大约写于这年秋天。\n文学赏析：《归燕诗》是一首咏物诗，所咏的是将要归去的燕子，但诗人并没有工细地描绘燕子的体态和风神，而是叙述与议论多于精工细雕的刻画，是一首妙用比兴、寓意深长的诗。\n首联“海燕虽微眇，乘春亦暂来”，从海燕“微眇”写起。诗人作为唐玄宗开元年间的名相，是以直言敢谏著称的，因而遭到李林甫等毁谤，从此以后，玄宗渐渐疏远张九龄，在开元二十四年那年被罢相。诗人在此借“海燕”之“微眇”来隐喻自己微贱之身，暗含着自己不像李林甫那样出身华贵。对句“乘春亦暂来”，这一句承上“海燕”而来，表面是说，海燕乘着春天的美好时光而来，即使时间不长但也来了。诗人借燕子的春来秋去来暗示自己在圣明的时代暂时来朝廷做官。一个“暂”字，不仅说燕子也已经来了，同时也暗示了自己来朝为官时间不长。这一联，诗人通过景物的描写，寓情于景，抒发了自己为民做事，忠于朝廷的情怀。\n颔联“岂知泥滓贱，只见玉堂开”。这一联承上联想“燕子”而来。出句“岂知泥滓贱”中，“泥滓贱”喻指李林甫之类的小人。燕子衔泥筑巢，而不知“泥滓”之贱。这里，诗人借此暗示自己对李林甫这样的小人还认识是不太清楚。一个“贱”字，不但写出了李林甫这样的卑微，也表现出诗人对李林甫之流的厌恶。出句“只见玉堂开”，这里，诗人以燕子出入“玉堂”之中，衔泥作窠的辛苦，比喻自己在朝廷为相而日夜辛劳之状。诗人以物喻人，不但形象生动，而且含蓄蕴藉，不但引起读者的思考，而且也给读者以审美想象的空间。\n颈联“绣户时双入，华堂日几回”，这一联紧承颔联中的“玉堂开”而来。在对偶中，具体表现出自己为朝廷效忠和大度的胸襟。诗句中的“绣户”、“华堂”和前面的“玉堂”都是隐喻朝廷。“双”即指诗人和李林甫两人。“时双入”即每天双双（指诗人和李林甫）进入朝廷。这里，诗人表现了自己没有把李林甫当成有敌意的人，从而表现出诗人为了朝廷而忘记个人的私事，也表现出诗人为朝廷、为国家而所具有的开阔心胸。出句“华堂日几回”中的“日几回”即每天进出几次。这里，诗人通过数量词表明了工作的繁忙景象——来去匆匆，更表现出对朝廷忠心耿耿。\n尾联“无心与物竞，鹰隼莫相猜”，这一联集中表现出诗人对朝廷的忠诚而忘却自己之情。出句“无心与物竞”，意思是说，我没有心思和精力与外物竞争，实际上表明了诗人尽心工作，为朝廷效力。末句“鹰隼莫相猜”，这里，诗人表面写的“猛禽”，实则是诗人在告诫李林甫之流，我无心与你争权夺利，不必猜忌，更不必中伤（也许哪天我要退隐了）。那时候，朝廷大权已经落在李林甫手中，张九龄自知不可能有所作为，不得不退让，但心中不无牢骚和感慨。这正如唐代诗人刘禹锡在《吊张曲江序》中称张九龄被贬之后说：“有拘囚之思，托讽禽鸟，寄词草树，郁郁然与骚人同风。”可见，诗人张九龄在面对强敌对手时，清醒与明智，也看出张九龄在文学创作中的巧妙——以物喻人，含蓄蕴藉。\n这首律诗对仗工整，语言朴素，风格清淡，如“轻缣素练”（张说评张九龄语）一般。它名为咏物，实乃抒怀，既写燕，又写人，句句不离燕子，却又是张九龄的自我写照。作者的艺术匠心，主要就表现在他选择了最能模写自己的形象的外物——燕子。句句诗不离燕子，但又不黏于燕子，达到不即不离的艺术境界。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴海燕：在中国古代，把比较宽阔的水域均成为海。“海燕”即指燕子。\n⑵虽微渺：虽然卑下低贱。\n⑶亦：也。\n⑷泥滓（ní
