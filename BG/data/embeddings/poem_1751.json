张九龄\n正文：万丈红泉落，迢迢半紫氛。\n奔流下杂树，洒落出重云。\n日照虹霓似，天清风雨闻。\n灵山多秀色，空水共氤氲。\n分类：山水 瀑布\n文学赏析：第一句中“万丈洪泉落”，万丈有多高，实在让人难以想象，诗人要表达的正是心中那种不可确凿道出的对匡庐飞瀑雄奇险壮之气势的深深折服与崇爱之情。水自地下往上涌出曰之为泉，诗人以泉喻瀑，言飞瀑如洪泉而落，仿佛是将泉跟倒置了过来，任其泉水喷涌而下、源源不绝，所述情状极为形象，令人啧啧生叹。“迢迢半紫氛”一句状写的则是伴随着瀑布飞落而升腾起的缥缈水气。李白七绝《望庐山瀑布水》开篇就说高峭挺拔的香炉峰在旭日红光的映照下紫气蒸腾，烟雾缭绕，如同幻境一般，张九龄所言的“紫氛”大抵就是这种“日照香炉生紫烟”的神奇气象。迢迢，写雾霭之高；半，写紫雾似将色瀑截断。高高漂浮的水雾尚且只在瀑布半腰，那么洪泉万丈的源头，自然是深隐于一派迷蒙与虚无之中了。\n“奔流下杂树，洒落出重云”。第二联着重于展现瀑布飞泻云天的动感之美。庐山峰青峦秀，嘉木成阴，喷雪鸣雷般的银瀑从几重云外奔流而下，激荡着嶙峋的山岩，穿越过层叠的古木，义无反顾地坠入深密的涧谷，这壮景所带来的强烈视觉震撼富有艺术感染力，大自然那磅礴潇洒的超凡手笔令人钦佩。庐山有景如此，无怪乎自古就赢得”匡庐奇秀甲天下”之盛誉了。\n第三联意在描绘飞瀑在阳光照耀下呈现来的奇幻风采，“日照虹霓似，天清风雨闻”。转写瀑布的色彩和声响。瀑布本如素练，但在晴日阳光的照射下，却幻化出虹霓般七彩缤纷的颜色，绚丽瑰奇；天清气朗之时，本无风雨，但万丈洪泉直泻而下时发出的巨大声响，却使人有急风骤雨杂沓的听觉感受。诗人绘声绘色，以自己独到的感受营造出那亦真亦幻、瑰丽迷人的美妙画面。在湖口远望庐山瀑布，是否真能听到它所发出的巨大声响，并不重要，关键是诗人从万丈洪泉直泻而下的气势中，仿佛听到了风狂雨骤般的杂沓声响。句末的“闻”字与上句的“似”字对举互文，本身就包含了“似闻”的意蕴。这是一种似真似幻的听觉感受，其传神处正在亦真亦幻之间。若认定“闻”字是几十里外清晰听到瀑布的巨响，反而拘泥而失语妙。\n“灵山多秀色，空水共氤氲”，最后一联以山水总括之笔收束全篇。诗人喜爱庐山之毓秀钟灵，故以“灵山”称谓之。“空水”一句由南朝谢灵运《登江中孤屿》一诗化用而来。谢诗云：”云日相辉映，空水共澄鲜。”意指空气和水色都清澄新鲜，诗人此处易“澄鲜”一词为“氤氲”，重在凸显庐山水瀑雾气缭绕、与晴空漫成一片的融融气象。“天地氤氲，万物化醇”（《易经·系辞》），庐山水正是乾坤交合而孕育出来的人间胜境。\n总起来看，诗中所写瀑布水，来自高远，穿过阻碍，摆脱迷雾，得到光照，更闻其声，积天地化成之功，不愧为秀中之杰。形象的比喻诗人遭遇和情怀，所以他在摄取瀑布水什么景象，采用什么手法，选择什么语言，表现什么特点，实则都依照自己的遭遇和情怀来取舍的。这也是此诗具有独特的艺术成就的主要原因。既然瀑布景象就是诗人自我化身，则比喻与被比者一体，其比兴寄托也就易于不露斧凿痕迹。\n相对于李白的七绝《望庐山瀑布水》而言，张九龄的这首五律有着四十字的篇幅，其铺展才思的空间更大。诗人善于运用繁笔，其言瀑布之雄险，以巍峨“灵山”为背景。先直抒“万丈”“迢迢”之豪叹，后辅以“杂树”“重云”为衬托；其言瀑布之绚丽，先描绘“洪泉”“紫氛”的真实所见，后生发出“虹霓”隐隐约约的奇妙幻觉；不仅如此，诗人还以“天清风雨闻”壮其声威，以”空水共氤氲”显其浑然。浓墨重彩而又繁简得当，毫不繁冗，正是诗人技法娴熟的体现。\n作为一首山水诗，这首诗的艺术是独特而成功的。这首诗表面上只是在描写、赞美瀑布景象，有一种欣赏风景、吟咏山水的名士气度。但其中蕴激情，怀壮志，显出诗人胸襟开阔，风度豪放，豪情满怀，其艺术效果是奇妙有味的。“诗言志”，山水即人，这首山水诗是一个成功的例证。\n现代译文：韵译\n\n⑴湖口：即鄱阳湖口，当时归洪州大都督府管辖。湖口遥对庐山，能见山头云雾变幻及瀑布在日光映照下闪耀的色彩。庐山，在今江西省。\n⑵洪泉：指水丰势强的瀑布。\n⑶迢迢（tiáo）：形容瀑布之长。紫氛：紫色的水气。\n⑷杂树：瀑布岩壁边杂乱的树木。\n⑸重云：层云。\n⑹虹霓（ní）：阳光射入窜的水珠，经过折射、反射形成的自然现象。\n⑺天清：天气清朗。闻：听到。\n⑻灵山：指庐山。秀色：壮美景色。\n⑼空：天空中的云。氤氲（yīn
