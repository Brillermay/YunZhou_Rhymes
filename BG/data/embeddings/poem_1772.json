佚名\n正文：烈文辟公，锡兹祉福。\n惠我无疆，子孙保之。\n无封靡于尔邦，维王其崇之。\n念兹戎功，继序其皇之。\n无竞维人，四方其训之。\n不显维德，百辟其刑之。\n於乎，前王不忘！\n分类：诗经 赞颂\n创作背景：这是周成王姬诵即位祭祀祖先时，戒勉助祭诸侯的诗。周武王伐商得到了广泛的支持，“是时诸侯不期而会盟津者八百”，武王在《尚书·牧誓》中罗列所率讨伐纣王大军的各部为“我友邦冢君、御事、司徒、司空、亚旅、师氏、千夫长、百夫长及庸、蜀、羌、髳、微、卢、彭、濮人”，其中除了自己的部下之外，便是赶来助战的八百诸侯。\n灭纣之后，周室所采取的一个巩固政权的重要措施便是分封诸侯：“武王既已胜殷，制邦国以封有功者为诸侯；既封为国君，乃班赋宗庙彝器以赐之。”\n在武王革命中助战的诸侯受到分封，同时也享有周王室祭祀先王时助祭的政治待遇，《周颂·烈文》便是这种情况的一个记录。《毛诗序》说：“《烈文》，成王即政，诸侯助祭也。”即政，当是周公还政于成王，成王正式掌权之时。武王灭商后二年去世，即位的成王年幼，由叔父周公摄政，平定了管叔、蔡叔、武庚的叛乱，七年后还政于成王。成王掌政，祭祀祖先，诸侯前来助祭，因赋此诗。其作者可能是周成王姬诵或周公姬旦。\n文学赏析：《周颂·烈文》对诸侯具有安抚与约束的双重作用。全诗共十三句，不分章，可按安抚与约束之意分为两层：前四句和后九句。前四句是以赞扬诸侯的赫赫功绩来达到安抚的目的。这种赞扬可以说臻于极致：不仅赐予周王福祉，而且使王室世世代代受益无穷。助祭的诸侯都是周王室的功臣，被邀来助祭本身就是一种殊荣，而祭祀时周王肯定其功绩，感谢其为建立、巩固周政权所作的努力，使诸侯在祭坛前如英雄受勋，荣耀非常，对周王室的感激之情便油然而生。\n但是，周王为君临四海的天子，对诸侯仅有安抚，只让诸侯怀感激之情是不够的，他还必须对诸侯加以约束，使诸侯生敬畏之心。后九句以“无”领起，这个“无”通“毋”，释“不要”，为具强烈感情色彩的祈使词，使文气从赞扬急转为指令，文意则由安抚转为约束。七句中用了两个这样的“无”，以断然的语气，训诫诸侯必须遵从；“百辟其刑之”，更是必须效法先王的明确训令；而“前王不忘”似乎只是训诫诸侯不要忘记先王之德，却又隐含不要忘记先王曾伐灭了不可一世的商纣，成王也在周公的辅佐下平定了管叔、蔡叔、武庚的叛乱，即不要忘记周王室具有扫荡摧毁一切敌对势力的雄威。\n后九句的指令、训戒，具有一个非常重要的作用，即正名。《左传·昭公七年》：“天子经略，诸侯正封，古之制也。封略之内，何非君土？食土之毛，谁非君臣？故《诗》曰：‘普天之下，莫非王土；率土之滨，莫非王臣。’”这段话中所说的君臣名分，与《周颂·烈文》这首诗所表达的完全一致。后者虽然没有点出“君臣”二字，含义却更加深刻：诸侯的功绩再大，也不过是尽臣子的本分而已，并且仍要一如既往这么做下去；周王的号令诸侯，乃是行君临天下的威权，并将绵延至子孙万代。\n现代译文：有功有德众诸侯，天赐你们莫大福。给我恩惠也无量，子孙长保此福祥。莫在你国铸大错，一心尊崇周君王。\n\n⑴烈：武功。一说“光明”。文：文德。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1772","poet":"先秦
