赞颂\n文学赏析：这首诗，《毛诗序》以为是尹吉甫美宣王，但吴闿生却认为是讥刺。他在《诗义会通》中说：“案《崧高》、《烝民》二诗，微指略同。皆讥宣王疏远贤臣，不能引以自辅，语虽褒美，而意指具在言外，所以为微文深意。《序》皆未能发其义。《烝民》语意较显，汉儒犹有知之者，此篇则喻者益少。然二篇笔意相似，惟此为弥隐耳。先大夫曰：迭称王命，所以深著王之远贤。郑笺云：‘申伯忠臣，不欲离王室。’最得其旨。殆三家遗说，郑偶采及之，非毛义也。‘不显申伯’三句，先大夫曰：‘深惜其远去也。’”这首诗应是尹吉甫赠给在王室为卿士而又出为方伯的申伯的。其旨意是歌颂申伯辅佐周室、镇抚南方侯国的功劳。同时也写了宣王对申伯的优渥封赠及不同寻常的礼遇。西周末期，其南方有荆蛮、申、吕、应、邓、陈、蔡、随、唐等侯国。由于王室卑微，这其中一些渐渐强大起来的诸侯并不怎么顺从王室，叛乱时有发生，所以派谁去统领侯国，安抚南方，对当时的周王室来说，就是迫在眉睫的头等大事了。申国为周初所封，西周末年依然强大，在众侯国中有一定的威望。申伯入朝为卿士，在朝中有很高威信。鉴于当时的形势，再加上申伯是王室贵戚（宣王元舅），故宣王改大其邑，派他去作南方方伯。所以，宣王分封申伯于谢，有其政治目的，完全是以巩固周王室的统治为出发点的。清人李黼平《毛诗纳义》曰：“自共和时，荆楚渐张，故召穆公有追荆至洛之役。宣王时，势当又炽，南方诸侯必有畔而从之者，故加申伯为侯伯，以为连属之监，一时控制之宜，抚绥之略，皆于此诗见焉。”尹吉甫为什么对分封申伯于谢之事加以郑重叙写，周王为什么在分封时反覆叮咛、殷勤眷注，为什么京师之人看到申伯启程欢欣鼓舞，知道了上述情况，就不难明白其中的原因了。\n从布局谋篇及结构上看，这首诗有明确的线索，一定的顺序。全诗八章。首章叙申伯降生之异，总叙其在周朝的地位和诸侯中的作用。次章叙周王派召伯去谢地相定申伯之宅。三章分述宣王对申伯、召伯及傅御之命。四章写召伯建成谢邑及寝庙。五章为周王期待申伯为天子效命的临别赠言。六章叙宣王在郿地为申伯饯行。七章叙申伯启程时的盛况。末章述申伯荣归封地，不负重望，给各国诸侯们作出了榜样，并点明此诗作意。可以看出，作者是以王命为线索，以申伯受封之事为中心，基本按照事件发展的经过来进行叙写的。但由于要表示宣王对申伯的宠眷倚重，故诗中又每事申言，不厌句义重复，可以说这是《崧高》一诗的显著特征。严粲《诗缉》说：“此诗多申复之词，既曰‘王命召伯，定申伯之宅’，又曰‘申伯之功，召伯是营’。既曰‘南国是式’，又曰‘式是南邦’。既曰‘于邑于谢’，又曰‘因是谢人，以作尔庸’。既曰‘王命召伯，彻申伯土田’，又曰‘王命召伯，彻申伯土疆’。既曰‘谢于诚归’，又曰‘既入于谢’。既曰‘登是南邦，世执其功’，又曰‘南土是保’。既曰‘四牡蹻蹻，钩膺濯濯’，又曰‘路车乘马’。此诗每事申言之，写丁宁郑重之意，自是一体，难以一一穿凿分别也。”“王命召伯，彻申伯土疆”两句，孔颖达疏曰：“此复云‘王命召伯’者，召伯营谢既成，遣使报王，王知城郭既了，又复命以此事。”顾广誉《学诗详说》评曰：“此以辞害意也。只是一时一事，此乃溯原申伯之归谢所由得遄行耳。《集传》谓：‘召伯之营谢也，则已敛其税赋，积其餱粮，使庐市有止宿之委积，故能使申伯无留行也。’盖举其国中之峙粻，而在道固不待言矣。”正因为孔颖达不视王命为“一体”，强加分别，附会穿凿，所以招致顾氏之讥。\n这首诗的起首二句“崧高维岳，骏极于天”为后人所激赏。方玉润说：“起笔峥嵘，与岳势竞隆。”又曰：“发端严重庄凝，有泰山岩岩气象。中兴贤佐，天子懿亲，非此手笔不足以称题。”“后世杜甫呈献巨篇，专学此种。”（《诗经原始》）既指出起句的艺术特征，又点明了它的用意和深远影响。读此二句，首先让读者联想起的倒不是杜甫的“呈献巨篇”，而是其《咏怀古迹》第一首的开头两句“群山万壑赴荆门，生长明妃尚有村”及其评语。有人说这二句：“发端突兀，是七律中第一等起句，谓山水逶迤，钟灵毓秀，始产一明妃。说得窈窕红颜，惊天动地...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1661","poet":"先秦
