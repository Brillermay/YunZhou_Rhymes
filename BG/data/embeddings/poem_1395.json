赞美 写人\n文学赏析：这篇诗是《大雅》的首篇，歌颂周王朝的奠基者文王姬昌。朱熹《诗集传》据《吕氏春秋·古乐》篇为此诗解题曰：“周人追述文王之德，明国家所以受命而代殷者，皆由于此，以戒成王。”这指明此诗创作在西周初年，作者是周公。后世说《诗》，多从此说。余培林《诗经正诂》说：“观诗中文字，恳切叮咛，谆谆告戒，……故其说是也。至此诗之旨，四字可以尽之，曰：‘敬天法祖。’”此论可谓简明的当。\n《诗经》中有多篇歌颂文王的诗，而序次以此篇为首，因为它的作者是西周王朝的政治代表人物、被颂扬为“圣人”的周公，诗的内容表达了重大的政治主题，对西周统治阶级具有现实的和长远的重要政治意义。\n歌颂文王，是《雅》、《颂》的基本主题之一。这是因为文王是周人崇敬的祖先，伟大的民族英雄，周王国的缔造者。姬昌积五十年的艰苦奋斗，使僻处于西北的一个农业小国，逐渐发展为与殷商王朝抗衡的新兴强国，他奠定了新王朝的基础；他又是联合被侵略被压迫的各民族，结成统一战线，反抗殷商王朝暴虐统治的政治联盟的领袖；他组织的军事力量和政治力量，在他生前已经完成对殷王朝的三面包围，完成了灭商的决战准备；他采取比较开明的政策，以代天行道、反对暴政实行“仁德”为旗帜，适合当时各民族各阶级反对暴虐统治与奴隶要求解放的时代潮流，因而得到各族人民的拥护。他死后三年，武王继承他的遗志，运用他组织的力量，抬着他的木主伐商，一战成功，推翻了殷商奴隶主政权，建立了比较开明的周王朝。文王是当之无愧的周王国国父，对他的歌颂，自然成为许多诗篇的共同主题。每个时代都曾产生自己时代的颂歌，歌颂自己时代深受爱戴的政治领袖，歌颂为自己的民族、阶级、国家建立功业的英雄，歌颂文王的诗篇，就是在上述现实基础上理所当然的历史产物。\n如同每个时代的颂歌都体现它们产生时的时代精神，文王颂歌也打上奴隶制向封建制过渡时期的时代烙印。诗篇歌颂他是天之子，具有非凡的人格和智慧，是道德的楷模，天意的化身，赐予人民光明和幸福的恩主，是把他神圣化、偶像化了。\n这篇诗与其他的文王颂歌有相同之处，也有不同之处。除了歌颂之外，作者还以深谋远虑、富有政治经验的政治家的识见，向时王和全宗族的既得利益者，提出敬天法祖、以殷为鉴的告戒，以求得周王朝的长治永安。\n全诗七章，每章八句。第一章言文王得天命兴国，建立新王朝是天帝意旨；第二章言文王兴国福泽子孙宗亲，子孙百代得享福禄荣耀；第三章言王朝人才众多得以世代继承传统；第四章言因德行而承天命兴周代殷，天命所系，殷人臣服；第五章言天命无常，曾拥有天下的殷商贵族已成为服役者；第六章言以殷为鉴，敬天修德，才能天命不变，永保多福；第七章言效法文王的德行和勤勉，就可以得天福佑，长治久安。\n很明显，贯穿全诗始终的是从殷商继承下来，又经过重大改造的天命论思想。天命论本来是殷商奴隶主的政治哲学，即“君权神授”，统治者的权力是天帝赐予的，奉行天的旨意实行在人间的统治，统治者所做的一切都是天意，天意永远不会改变。周王朝推翻殷商的统治，也借用天命，作为自己建立统治的理论根据，而吸取殷商亡国的经验教训，提出“天命无常”、“唯德是从”，上天只选择有德的人来统治天下，统治者失德，便会被革去天命，而另以有德者来代替，文王就是以德而代殷兴周的。所以文王的子孙要以殷为鉴，敬畏上帝，效法文王的德行，才能永保天命。这是此诗的中心思想。\n全诗没有空发议论，而是通过对文王功业和德行的歌颂，以事实为依据，动之以情，晓之以理。如歌颂文王福泽百世，启发对文王恩德的感戴之情，弦外之音就是：如果没有文王创立的王朝，就没有今日和后世的荣显。作者又以殷商的亡国为鉴戒，殷商人口比原来的周国多得多，却因丧失民心而失败，再用殷贵族沦为周朝的服役者这一事实，引起警戒。全诗恳切叮咛，谆谆教导，有劝勉，有鼓励，有启发，有引导，理正情深，表现了老政治家对后生晚辈的苦口婆心。在文王颂歌中，这是思想深刻、艺术也较为成功的一篇。\n全诗七章，章八句，五十六句中除三句五言外，均为四言，章句结构整齐。每章换韵，韵律和谐。最突出之处，是诗中成功地运用了连珠顶真的修辞技巧：前章与后章的词句相连锁，后章的起句承接前章的末句...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1395","poet":"先秦
