佚名\n正文：悠悠昊天，曰父母且。\n无罪无辜，乱如此幠。\n昊天已威，予慎无罪。\n昊天大幠，予慎无辜。\n乱之初生，僭始既涵。\n乱之又生，君子信谗。\n君子如怒，乱庶遄沮。\n君子如祉，乱庶遄已。\n君子屡盟，乱是用长。\n君子信盗，乱是用暴。\n盗言孔甘，乱是用餤。\n匪其止共，维王之邛。\n奕奕寝庙，君子作之。\n秩秩大猷，圣人莫之。\n他人有心，予忖度之。\n跃跃毚兔，遇犬获之。\n荏染柔木，君子树之。\n往来行言，心焉数之。\n蛇蛇硕言，出自口矣。\n巧言如簧，颜之厚矣。\n彼何人斯？居河之麋。\n无拳无勇，职为乱阶。\n既微且尰，尔勇伊何？为犹将多，尔居徒几何？\n分类：诗经 伤怀\n文学赏析：此诗主题在于忧谗忧谤，同时揭露了谗言惑国的卑鄙行径。作者应是饱受谗言之苦，全诗写得情感异常激愤，通篇直抒胸臆，毫无遮拦。起调便是令人痛彻心肺的呼喊：“悠悠昊天，曰父母且。无罪无辜，乱如此幠。”随即又是苍白而带有绝望的申辩：“昊天已威，予慎无罪！昊天泰幠，予慎无辜！”情急愤急之下，作者竟无法用实情加以洗刷，只是面对苍天，反覆地空喊，这正是蒙受奇冤而又无处伸雪者的典型表现。\n二、三两章，情感稍缓，作者痛定思痛后对谗言所起，乱之所生进行了深刻的反省与揭露。在作者看来，进谗者固然可怕、可恶，但谗言乱政的根源不在进谗者而在信谗者，因为谗言总要通过信谗者起作用。谗言如同鸦片，人人皆知其毒性，但它又总能给人带来眼前的虚幻的快感。因此，如果不防患于未然，一旦沾染，便渐渐使人产生依赖感，最终为其所害，到时悔之晚矣。作者在第四章中的描述实际上说明了一个道理：天子的独特处境、地位使其天生地缺乏这种免疫力。故与其说刺小人，毋宁说在刺君子。可谓深刻至极。此二章句句如刀，刀刀见血，将“君子信谗”的过程及结局解剖得丝丝入扣，筋骨毕现。“盗言孔甘，乱是用餤”是送给后世当政者的一付清醒剂。盖因听谗者比之进谗者责任更大，故先刺之。可见愤激的情感并未使作者丧失理智。\n四、五两章，形同漫画，又活画出进谗者阴险、虚伪的丑陋面目。他们总是为一己之利，而置社稷、民众于不顾，处心积虑，暗使阴谋，欲置贤良之士于死地而后快。但险恶的内心表现出来的却是花言巧语、卑琐温顺，在天子面前，或“蛇蛇硕言”，或“巧言如簧”。作者的描绘入木三分，揭下了进谗者那张赖以立身的画皮，令人有“颜之厚矣”终不敌笔锋之利矣的快感。\n末章具体指明进谗者为何人。因指刺对象的明晰而使诗人的情感再次走向剧烈，以至于按捺不住，直咒其“既微且尰”，可见作者对进谗者的恨之入骨。那“居河之麋”的交待，使读者极易联想起躲在水边“含沙射影”的鬼蜮。然而，无论小人如何猖獗，就如上章所言“跃跃毚兔”，最终会“遇犬获之”。因为小人的鼠目寸光，使他们在获得个人利益的同时，往往也将自己送上了绝路。从这个角度看，作者不仅深刻地揭露了进谗者的丑恶，也清醒地看到了进谗者的可耻下场。\n此诗虽是从个人遭谗人手，但并未落入狭窄的个人恩怨之争，而是上升到谗言误国、谗言惑政的高度加以批判，因此，不仅感情充沛，而且带有了普遍的历史意义与价值，这正是此诗能引起后人共鸣的关键之处。\n现代译文：高高远远那苍天，如同人之父与母。没有罪也没有过，竟遇大祸难免除。苍天已经大发威，但我确实没错处。苍天不察太疏忽，但我确实是无辜。\n\n1.昊天：老天，苍天。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1057","poet":"先秦
