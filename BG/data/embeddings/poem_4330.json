贺知章\n正文：碧玉妆成一树高，万条垂下绿丝绦。\n不知细叶谁裁出，二月春风似剪刀。\n分类：小学古诗 写景 咏物 春天 写风 柳树\n文学赏析：杨柳的形象美是在于那曼长披拂的枝条。一年一度，它长出了嫩绿的新叶，丝丝下垂，在春风吹拂中，有着一种迷人的意态。这是谁都能欣赏的。古典诗词中，借用这种形象美来形容、比拟美人苗条的身段，婀娜的腰身，也是读者所经常看到的。这诗别出新意，翻转过来。“碧玉妆成一树高”，一开始，杨柳就化身为美人而出现：“万条垂下绿丝绦”，这千条万缕的垂丝，也随之而变成了她的裙带。上句的“高”字，衬托出美人婷婷袅袅的风姿；下句的“垂”字，暗示出纤腰在风中款摆。诗中没有“杨柳”和“腰支”字样，然而这早春的垂柳以及柳树化身的美人，却给写活了。《南史》说刘悛之为益州刺史，献蜀柳数株，“条甚长，状若丝缕。”齐武帝把这些杨柳种植在太昌云和殿前，玩赏不置，说它“风流可爱”。这里把柳条说成“绿丝绦”，可能是暗用这个关于杨柳的著名典故。但这是化用，看不出一点痕迹的。\n“碧玉妆成”引出了“绿丝绦”，“绿丝绦”引出了“谁裁出”，最后，那视之无形的不可捉摸的“春风”，也被用“似剪刀”形象化地描绘了出来。这“剪刀”裁制出嫩绿鲜红的花花草草，给大地换上了新妆，它正是自然活力的象征，是春给予人们美的启示。从“碧玉妆成”到“剪刀”，读者可以看出诗人艺术构思一系列的过程。诗歌里所出现的一连串的形象，是一环紧扣一环的。\n我国古代有不少著名的美女，柳，为什么单单要用碧玉来比呢？这有两层意思：一是碧玉这名字和柳的颜色有关，“碧”和下句的“绿”是互相生发、互为补充的。二是碧玉这个人在人们头脑中永远留下年轻的印象。提起碧玉，人们就会联想到“碧玉破瓜时”这首广泛流传的《碧玉歌》，还有“碧玉小家女”（肖绎《采莲赋》）之类的诗句。碧玉在古代文学作品里，几乎成了年轻貌美的女子的泛称。用碧玉来比柳，人们就会想象到这美人还未到丰容盛鬋的年华；这柳也还是早春稚柳，没有到密叶藏鸦的时候；和下文的“细叶”“二月春风”又是有联系的。\n“碧玉妆成一树高，万条垂下绿丝绦”，深深地抓着了垂柳的特征，在诗人的眼中，它似美女的化身。高高的树干，就像她亭亭玉立的风姿，下垂的柳条，就像她裙摆上的丝带。在这里，柳就是人，人就是柳，两者之间仿佛没有什么截然的分别。而且“碧玉”也有双关的意义。既在字面上与柳树的翠色相合，又指年轻貌美的少女，与下面的“二月春风”恰相呼应——这是早春的垂柳，还未到夏秋之际亭亭如盖、树荫清圆的时候。然而，更妙的以下两句：“不知细叶谁载出，二月春风似剪刀。”在贺知章之前，有谁想过春风像剪刀？把乍暖还寒的二月春风由无形化为有形，它显示了春风的神奇灵巧，并使《咏柳》成为咏物诗的典范之作。\n此诗借柳树歌咏春风，把春风比作剪刀，说她是美的创造者，赞美她裁出了春天。诗中洋溢着人逢早春的欣喜之情。比拟和比喻新奇贴切是此诗的成功之处。因此《唐诗笺注》云：“赋物入妙，语意温柔。”\n现代译文：\n\n\n碧玉：碧绿色的玉。这里用以比喻春天嫩绿的柳叶。\n妆：装饰，打扮。\n一树：满树。一：满，全。在中国古典诗词和文章中，数量词在使用中并不一定表示确切的数量。下一句的“万”，就是表示很多的意思。\n绦（tāo）：用丝编成的绳带。这里指像丝带一样的柳条。\n裁：裁剪。\n似：如同，好像。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"4330","poet":"唐代
