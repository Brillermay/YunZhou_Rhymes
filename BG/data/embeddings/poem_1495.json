赞颂 写人\n文学赏析：这首诗的主旨，前人多有阐述。清代学者方玉润在《诗经原始》中已经透露出西周开国君主文王、武王的业绩所起的继往开来的作用。在周族的漫长艰苦历程中，最早是周始祖后稷被封于有邰（在今陕西武功），至十代孙公刘由有邰迁到豳（在今陕西邠县），到了周文王的祖父古公亶父（即周太王）又从豳迁到岐山（在今陕西岐山），都是具有里程碑意义的。在文王、武王父子两代，文王继承前代的功业，当了“西伯”，殷纣王分庭抗礼的地步，为灭殷奠定了坚实的基础；周武王秉承父志，又进一步扩展势力，再建都于镐京，终于完成了灭殷的统一大业。西周王朝建立之后，周武王的子孙面临的是如何巩固基业的问题。《文王有声》末章说：“丰水有芑，武王岂不仕？诒厥孙谋，以燕翼子。”正点明了这个要害问题，可谓是画龙点睛之笔。\n这首诗在艺术表现上也有它的特色，可供借鉴：\n（一）按时间先后顺序谋篇布局。周文王、周武王同是西周开国的君主，但他们是父子两代，一前一后不容含混，因之全诗共八章，前四章写周文王迁丰，后四章写周武王营建镐京，读之次序井然。诗题《文王有声》是套用《诗经》的惯例，用诗的开头第一句，但也很好体现出周武王的功业是由其父周文王奠定基础的。\n（二）同写迁都之事，文王迁丰、武王迁镐，却又各有侧重。“言文王者，偏曰伐崇‘武功’，言武王者，偏曰‘镐京辟廱’，武中寓文，文中有武。不独两圣兼资之妙，抑亦文章幻化之奇，则更变中之变矣！”（方玉润语）\n（三）叙事与抒情结合，使全诗成为歌功颂德的杰作。前四章写周文王迁都于丰，有“既伐于崇，作邑于丰”、“筑城伊淢，作丰伊匹”、“王公伊濯，维丰之垣”等诗句，叙事中寓抒情。后四章写周武王迁镐京，有“丰水东注，维禹之绩”、“镐京辟廱，自西自东，自南自北，无思不服”、“考卜维王，宅是镐京；维龟正之，武王成之”等诗句，也是叙事中寓抒情。特别是全诗八章，每章五句的最后一句皆以单句赞词煞尾，赞美周文王是“文王烝哉”、“文王烝哉”、“王后烝哉”、“王后烝哉”，赞美周武王是“皇王烝哉”、“皇王烝哉”、“武王烝哉”、“武王烝哉”，使感情抒发得更强烈，可谓别开生面。\n（四）巧妙运用比兴手法，加强诗的形象感染力。如第四章“王公伊濯，维丰之垣；四方攸同，王后维翰”四句，是以丰邑城垣之坚固象征周文王的屏障之牢固。第八章“丰水有芑，武王岂不仕”二句，是以丰水岸边杞柳之繁茂象征周武王能培植人才、使用人才。\n（五）全诗用韵也富于变化。每章的前四句用韵，或者是句句用韵，如第一章声、声、宁、成叶耕部韵；或者是隔句用韵，如第二章功、丰叶东部韵，第四章垣、翰叶元部韵，第五章绩、辟叶锡部韵，第八章仕、子叶之部韵；或者是两句一换韵，如第三章淢、匹叶质部韵，欲、孝叶幽部韵，第六章廱、东叶东部韵，北、服叶职部韵，第七章王、京叶阳部韵，正、成叶耕部韵。又每章最后一句以“哉”字结尾，是使用遥韵。\n现代译文：文王有着好声望，如雷贯耳大名享。但求天下能安宁，终见功成国运昌。文王真个是明王！\n\n⑴遹（yù）：陈奂《诗毛氏传疏》：“全诗多言‘曰’、‘聿’，唯此篇四言‘遹’，遹即曰、聿，为发语之词。《说文》……引诗‘欥求厥宁’。从欠曰，会意，是发声。当以欥为正字，曰、聿、遹三字皆假借字。”\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1495","poet":"先秦
