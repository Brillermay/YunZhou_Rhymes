祭祀 乐歌\n文学赏析：这是一首记述殷商发迹史特别是歌颂商汤功德的长篇颂诗。全诗七章，每章句数不等，其结构形式与《诗经》大多数篇章整齐的四言体等句分章不同。有韵，又与《周颂》各篇大多无韵不同。其内容以歌颂成汤为主并追述先王功业，并兼及功臣，也与其他祭颂之诗不同。\n第一章追述商国立国历史悠久，商契受天命出生立国，所以商国一直蒙承天赐的吉祥。第二章歌颂商契建国施政使国家发展兴盛，以及先祖相土开拓疆土的武功。下章即转入歌颂成汤。第三章歌颂成汤继承和发展先祖功业，明德敬天，因而受天命而为九州之主。第四章歌颂成汤奉行天意温厚施政，刚柔适中，为诸侯表率，因得天赐百禄。第五章歌颂成汤的强大武力可以保障天下的安宁，为诸侯所依靠，因得天赐百禄。第六章歌颂成汤讨伐夏桀及其从国而平定天下。第七章歌颂成汤是上天之子，上帝降赐伊尹辅佐他建立功业。\n全诗从头到尾贯穿着殷商统治阶级的天命论思想：“君权天授”，他们是天帝的嫡裔，他们立国、开辟疆土、征伐异族、占有九州而统治各族人民，都是奉行上天的意旨，得到天的庇佑；他们建立的新王朝的统治权以及所有的福禄——权力、财富和显赫的荣耀，都得之于天，因为他们是天子及其嫡裔。统治阶级的这种意识形态，是他们建立统治的理论基础。诗中歌颂武功，即暴力掠夺和扩张，如“相土烈烈，海外有截”，“如火烈烈，则莫我敢曷”，“敷奏其勇，百禄是总”，统治权和享受的百禄，都来自运用本身强大力量进行的战争。崇尚勇武和战争，为侵略、镇压、掠夺和统治披上“天意”的伪装．正是殷商天命论的实质。\n诗中塑造了商王朝创造者成汤的形象。他继续祖业而积极进取，开创新王朝基业。他恭诚敬天，“帝命不违”，奉行天意，“上帝是祗”，因而获得天佑，“百禄是遒”，是忠诚的天之子；他英武威严，战无不克，“武王载旆，有虔秉钺”，冲锋敌阵，其气势“如火烈烈，则莫我敢曷”，既蔑视敌人，英勇无畏，又能采取正确的战略，从而征服天下，是智勇双全的英雄；他又是贤明的执政者，“不竞不絿，不刚不柔”，“圣敬曰跻，昭假迟迟”，励精图治，选贤与能，作诸侯的表率，是诸侯的依靠。《孟子·离娄下》也谈到商汤此人：“汤执中，立贤无方。”“执中”，即指汤“不竞不絿，不刚不柔”而言，是执政的必备品格；“立贤无方”，即“不拘一格”任用人才，指重用伊尹而言，传说伊尹本是奴隶，汤发现了他的才干，予以信任和重用，在伊尹辅佐下汤得以完成大业。诗中歌颂的成汤的这些品格，正是古代奴隶主贵族阶级的理想品格。对于汤，周代的政治家和思想家也是赞扬的，因为他的品格也是周代统治者的理想品格；不过，他们吸取殷商覆亡的教训，把殷商的天命论加以发展和改造，提出“天命无常，唯德是从”，认为天命不是永久不变的，上帝是道德神，仁德爱民才能获得和保持天命不变，因而突出执政者的道德，同时对理想人格也加以丰富和发挥，推动历史前进一大步。这些内容，从《周颂》和《大雅》都可以体会到。\n此诗具有史诗的因素，叙述的事件以殷商的史实为基础，同时像各民族上古的史诗一样，吸取了上古的许多神话传说素材，但又根据殷商统治阶级的功利及其意识形态，对神话传说有所取舍和改造。\n诗的结构形式并不整齐。在得以保存下来的五篇《商颂》中，这是章句和句式最不整齐的一篇。可能限于流传的版本不全，或资料不足，有所减略或增益，因而全诗叙事和各章内容详略不等。近人也有怀疑此诗有因错简而章次颠倒之处，如张松如《商颂绎释》，就将第四、五两章移为最后两章。\n此诗的叙述并不平直板滞，善于运用一些形象的语言，描写较为生动。韵律也较为整齐，除全诗末两句外，句句用韵，每章换韵。在句式上，多用对句，或上下句相对，或双句相对，或章句相对，行文变化多姿，使语言整齐匀称，内容凝炼集中，有较强的节律感，当是中国后世诗词对仗的滥觞。\n现代译文：翻译\n\n注释\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2162","poet":"先秦
