李隆基\n正文：夫子何为者，栖栖一代中。\n地犹鄹氏邑，宅即鲁王宫。\n叹凤嗟身否，伤麟怨道穷。\n今看两楹奠，当与梦时同。\n分类：唐诗三百首 写人 伤怀\n文学赏析：此诗意在“感叹”孔子的际遇。全诗以疑问入笔，表现出作者于孔子神像前谦恭行礼，心中感慨万千，口内喃喃自语的情状。作者着笔于“叹”“嗟”“伤”“怨”，写出了对己对孔子虽“叹”实“赞”之情，立意集于以“叹”代“赞”，既表达了自己对孔子一生郁郁不得志的叹息之情，又赞扬了孔子“明知其不可为而为之”的超凡脱俗的用世精神，发人深省。\n此诗用典极多。首联“夫子何为者？栖栖一代中”即出自《论语·宪问》：“微生亩问孔子曰：‘丘何为是栖栖者欤？无乃为佞乎？’孔子曰：‘非敢为佞，疾固也。’”此句本是孔子的愤懑之言，孔子自称忙忙碌碌，并非逞口舌之长，只是痛恨世人顽固不化，才著书立说，教化世人。作者化用此典故，抒发了自己的无限感慨，像孔子这样的大圣人，虽终其一生于诸侯之间，劳碌不停，但最终也未能实现自己的理想，这是非常悲哀的一件事。作者的同情之心，一览无余。另一方面，孔子一生奔波劳苦，为的却是天下的苍生，虽屡遭误解，仍孜孜以求，这又是无比可敬的。因此这一句诗便高度概括了孔子一生的功绩和高贵品质，也表达了作者对孔子的景仰和钦服。\n颔联承接上句，依旧是引用典故，赞叹了孔子的旧居，孔安国《尚书序》载：“鲁恭王坏孔子旧宅，以广其居，升堂闻金石丝竹之声，乃不坏宅。”写帝王诸侯想要扩建宫殿，也不敢妄动孔子的故居。表明孔子的功绩即便贵为王侯也望尘莫及，旨在高度评价孔子的尊崇地位。这里诗人借用此典故以孔子的旧邑故居因为其主人的威望，得以保存至今日，意在侧面说明孔子受后世万民的敬仰，故居尚且如此，何况孔子本人。含蓄、婉转地表达了自己对孔子的敬重之情。同时，在这里，诗人委婉地把帝王举止和孔子功绩结合起来，暗示读者自己也希望入孔子般，承载万民兴衰于双肩。\n颈联是孔子的自伤之词，也是借用典故，借孔子自叹命运不济，生不逢时，政治理想难以实现，真实再现了孔子当年孤寂，凄凉的心境。《论语·子罕》中载：“子曰：‘凤鸟不至，河不出图，吾已矣夫！”传说凤凰现身，河洛图出，是象征圣王出世的瑞兆，然而孔子生逢春秋乱世，刀兵四起。诸侯们只关心自己的领土、霸权、兵力，没有肯行仁义的圣王，因此孔子自叹儒学之道没有用武之地，而自己这些致力于推行德政的人也如那只被愚人猎捕的麒麟一般，早晚要被这个穷兵黜武的时代所绞杀。“嗟身否”感怀身世，“伤麟怨”则叹息王道难行。这些都足以唤起了人们对孔子的深深同情和深切的感慨。也表明作者决意推行仁政，以告慰孔子泉下亡灵。\n尾联既是孔子“昨日”的梦想，也是“今日”的现实，当然也可以理解为作者一直都有拜祭孔子灵位的梦想，终得实现。“两楹奠”出自《礼记·檀弓上》，本表示出祭奠礼仪的隆重与庄严，用于此，更意为后世对孔子的万分敬重，末句“与梦时同”又完全符合孔子生前梦见自己死后，灵柩停放在两楹之间的梦境。孔子不求生前得到大家的认同，只希望在自己死后，儒学能够得到弘扬，王道能够被人主推行，而今梦想成真，也算是对孔子辗转一生的弥补吧。诗人举目仰望，孔子的塑像正端坐在殿堂前的两楹之间，受人祭拜。作者满怀慰藉之情，祭拜于孔子的灵前，不论是叹惜、感伤，还是哀怨都深深地融入到了对孔子的“赞”中，以“与梦同”表达了自己对孔子梦想终于实现的欣慰之情，也表达了诗人对孔子的“明之其不可为而为之”这一用世精神终被广大人民所接受的肯定。\n这首诗追述了孔子一生郁郁不得志的悲惨遭遇，反映了孔子令人悲叹的命运。为实现“郁郁乎文哉”的理想社会，孔子一生碌碌奔波，结果却无处安身，甚至被困陈蔡，险些丧命。但孔子始终没有背叛自己的道德信仰。纵使明知凤图难出，王道难行，明知自己必将如麒麟般惨遭捕杀，也要坚守道德的崇高，只为将来自己的仁义思想能够大行于天下，为苍生谋福，也就在所不惜。既表达了自己对孔子的深切同情，又赞美和褒扬了孔子。结合史料可知，唐玄宗对儒学确实非常推崇，因而他对这位儒学创始人的感情也是真实而深挚的。正是因为作者能把自己的崇敬融入到孔子的深致悼念中，才使得这首诗读来深切质朴，令人信服。\n就艺术形式来看，这首诗句句用典颇有堆砌典故之嫌，且诗语质朴无华，在遣词造句上也并无推陈出新之处，算不上是上乘之作，但此诗所反映出的思想和胸襟在历代帝王之作中并不多见。这一点是值得肯定的。另外，悼念孔子所选择的视角十分准确也是一大成功之处。孔子一生生活复杂坎坷，此诗只选择他的栖遑不遇的一面，简单几言，就概括了孔子一生的大事。首两句是叹惜，三、四句是叹美，五、六句是再叹惜，后两句再叹美。全诗命意构思，严正得体。比及一般的咏叹之诗，颇显境界之大，立意之深。\n现代译文：尊敬的孔老夫子，你一生劳碌奔波，周游列国，究竟想要做成什么呢？\n\n⑴鲁：今山东曲阜，为春秋时鲁国都城。\n⑵夫子：这里是对孔子的敬称。何为者：犹“何为乎”。者：无...","metadata":{"poem_id":"3539","poet":"唐代
