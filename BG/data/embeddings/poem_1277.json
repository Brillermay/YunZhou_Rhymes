虞世南\n正文：垂緌饮清露，流响出疏桐。\n居高声自远，非是藉秋风。\n分类：咏物 寓理\n创作背景：李世民夺位李渊后，虞世南任弘文馆学士，成为重臣，但从不傲慢，踏实勤奋，使得李世民对其称赞有加，深得赏识，于是常邀他参加一些典礼活动。一天，李世民起了雅兴，邀请弘文馆学士们共赏海池景色，谈诗论画，李世民询问大家是否有新的诗歌作品，虞世南便诵读出该诗。\n文学赏析：这是初唐名臣虞世南的一首咏物诗，咏物中尤多寄托，具有浓郁的象征性。句句写的是蝉的形体、习性和声音，而句句又暗示着诗人高洁清远的品行志趣，物我互释，咏物的深层意义是咏人。关键要把握住蝉的某些别有意味的具体特征，从中找出艺术上的契合点。垂緌，是古代官帽打结下垂的带子，也指蝉的下巴上与帽带相似的细嘴。蝉用细嘴吮吸清露，由于语义双关，暗示着冠缨高官要戒绝腐败，追求清廉。蝉居住在挺拔疏朗的梧桐上，与那些在腐草烂泥中打滚的虫类自然不同，因此它的声音能够流丽响亮。诗的最后评点道，这完全是由于蝉能够“居高声自远”，而不是由于凭借秋风一类外力所致。这些诗句的弦外之音，它们所隐喻的深层意义无非是说，做官做人应该立身高处，德行高洁，才能说话响亮，声名远播。这种居高致远完全来自人格美的力量，绝非依凭见风使舵，或者什么权势、关节和捧场所能得到的。实际上，咏蝉包含着虞世南的夫子自道。他作为唐贞观年间画像悬挂在凌烟阁的二十四勋臣之一，名声在于博学多能，高洁耿介，与唐太宗谈论历代帝王为政得失，能够直言善谏，为贞观之治作出独特贡献。为此，唐太宗称他有“五绝”（德行、忠直、博学、文辞、书翰），并赞叹：“群臣皆如虞世南，天下何忧不理！”从他不是以鲲鹏鹰虎，而是以一只不甚起眼的蝉来自况，也可见其老成谨慎，以及有自知之明。\n这首托物寓意的小诗，是唐人咏蝉诗中时代最早的一首，很为后世人称道。 首句“垂緌饮清露”表面上是写蝉的形状与食性，实际上是运用比兴手法，暗示自己的显要身份和清廉的品质。蝉的头部有两根触须，形状似官员系在颈下的帽带；古人认为蝉栖身高树，只喝清洁的露水，因而用“饮清露”象征人的品格高洁。其实蝉是靠吸食植物的液汁生活的，哪里可能只喝露水？ 次句“流响出疏桐”写蝉鸣声。为什么说连续不断的蝉鸣声是从枝叶稀疏的梧桐中传出来的呢？这是因为梧桐在古人的心目中是一种高贵而灵异的树，传说鸾凤一类的鸟非梧桐不栖，“王者任用贤良，则梧桐生于东厢”。诗人以蝉自比，则其鸣声也就不同凡响。“桐”前着一“疏”，既让人感到“流响”的易于流传，又与末句“秋风”相应。 “居高声自远，非是藉秋风”，这是全篇比兴寄托的点睛之笔，是从上面两句引发出来的议论。意思是“蝉儿栖身高处，声音自然会传得很远。这并不是借助秋风的飞传”，沈德潜说：“命意自高，咏蝉者每咏其声，此独尊其品格。” 这一托物寓意的名句，既是写景，也是抒怀，是唐诗中最早咏蝉的，很为后世称道。虞世南原是陈隋旧臣，入唐后以文才和德行受到唐太宗的器重，他生性耿直孤傲，不合于世，显示出一种内向、孤僻、深沉的性格特征，虞世南借蝉咏怀，表明自己立身高洁，不需任何凭藉，自会扬名。情景交融，显得十分和谐自然。这两句用的是比喻，蝉声远传不是借藉于秋风的传送，这里所突出强调的是诗人的人格美，表达了诗人对自己内在品格的热情赞美，表现了一种雍容不迫的风度、气韵。读者可从中想像到人格化了的蝉儿那种清华隽朗的高标逸韵，可谓巧妙至极。正像曹丕在《典论o论文》中所言“不做良臣之辞，不托飞驰之势，而名声自传达于后”。“居高声自远。非是藉秋风”展示了一个清狂自负、踌躇满志的士大夫形象。 施朴华《岘佣说诗》曰：“《三百篇》比兴为多，唐人犹得其意。同一咏蝉，虞世南‘居高声自远，非是籍秋风’，是清华人语；骆宾王‘露重飞难进，风多响易沉’，是患难人语；李商隐‘本以高难饱，徒劳恨费声’，是牢骚人语，比兴不同如此。”同是唐人，又都是托咏蝉以寄意，由于作者的地位、遭际、气质彼此不同，虽同样工于比兴寄托，却呈现出殊异的面貌，形成富有个性特征的艺术形象。\n现代译文：\n\n\n①垂緌（ruí）：古人结在颔下的帽缨下垂部分,蝉的头部伸出的触须,形状与其有些相似。\n②清露：纯净的露水。古人以为蝉是喝露水生活的，其实是刺吸植物的汁液。\n③流响：指连续不断的蝉鸣声。\n④疏：开阔、稀疏。\n⑤藉：凭借。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1277","poet":"唐代
