赞颂\n创作背景：《大雅·江汉》一诗，《毛诗序》以为尹吉甫所作。今人以其无据多不相信。有人认为是召伯虎所作。其第一章诗人自称“我”，为第一人称手法写成；而第三章云：“江汉之浒，王命召虎。”说到周王之命，又自称“召虎”。第四、五、六章也有“王命召虎”、“虎拜稽首”等语。一般如果自称为“我”，而同周天子联系起来则称“召虎”、“虎”，则可以推定作者为召伯虎。此诗同传世的周代青铜器召伯虎簋上的铭文一样，都是记叙召伯虎平淮夷归来周王赏赐之事。\n据《后汉书·东夷传》，周厉王之时因为政治昏乱，东方的淮夷入寇，虢仲征之，未能取胜。宣王之时，首先消除玁狁之患，然后宣王亲征，平定淮夷之乱。宣王驻于江汉之滨，命召伯虎率军征之。召伯虎取胜归来，宣王大加赏赐，召伯虎因而作铜簋以纪其功事，并作此诗，以颂其祖召康公之德与天子之英明。\n文学赏析：淮夷在淮北，以徐国为主，故平淮夷也即《大雅·常武》所说之征徐国。因为此次伐淮夷，宣王亲征，驻于江汉之滨，召公的受命、誓师、率师出征俱在此，所以诗的前二章均以“江汉”为喻，借长江、汉水的宽阔水势，喻周天子大军浩浩荡荡的气势。也同样因为天子亲征，故曰“匪安匪游，淮夷来求”，“匪安匪舒，淮夷来铺”。意思是天子到此不是为了游乐，而是为了平定叛国。这几句前人未能明其深意，故或以为作为一个受命出征的大臣这样说有些多余。关于开头二句，王引之、陈奂都以为当作“江汉滔滔，武夫浮浮”，“浮浮”为众强之貌。这样与《风俗通义》引作“江汉陶陶”及《小雅·四月》“滔滔江汉”之语皆相合，其说颇为有理。\n此诗着重颂扬宣王之德，不在纪事，故关于淮夷战事未作具体描述。伐淮夷在尹吉甫和南仲伐玁狁之后，故诗中以“经营四方”一句，概括南征北讨之事而带过。盖因与淮夷作战为召伯之事，召伯不能自己夸耀自己的武功。以下由“告成于王”引起对赏赐仪式特别是宣王册命之词的纪述。由“式辟四方，彻我疆土；匪疚匪棘，王国来极；于疆于理，至于南海”可以看出一个打算有所作为的英明君主的雄才大略。由“文武受命，召公维翰；无曰予小子，召公是似”，又见其对朝廷老臣说话时恰如其分的谦虚和鼓励的语气，通过表彰召康公的业绩来表彰召伯虎，并激励他再建大功。第五、六章写宣王对召伯虎赏赐规格之高和召伯虎的感戴之情。全诗以“矢其文德，洽此四国”作结，表现出中兴君臣的共同愿望。\n诗中有些句子看似语意相似，其实却表现了不同的意思。如第一章“匪安匪游，淮夷来求”等，出于召伯之口，是说：宣王不求安乐，而勤劳于国事。第三章“匪疚匪棘，王国来极”，出于宣王之口，则是说：不是要给百姓造成骚扰，也不是急于事功，四方都必须以王朝政令为准，这是大事。第二章“四方既平，王国庶定；时靡有争，王心载宁”，同样表现了臣子对天子的体贴。而第三章“式辟四方，彻我疆土”，则出之周王之口，体现着“溥天之下，莫非王土”的观念。\n召伯虎救过太子静（宣王）的命，又扶其继位，辅佐宣王化解宗族矛盾，和合诸侯，平定外患，其功盖世。然而，正因为这样，他更要注重君臣之礼，以身作则地维护周朝统治阶级的宗法制度。这首诗就表现了老功臣的这样一种意识。\n现代译文：长江汉水波涛滚滚，出征将士意气风发。不为安逸不为游乐，要对淮夷进行讨伐。前路已经出动兵车，树起彩旗迎风如画。不为安逸不为舒适，镇抚淮夷到此驻扎。\n\n1.江汉：长江与汉水。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1694","poet":"先秦
