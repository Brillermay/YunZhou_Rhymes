佚名\n正文：溱与洧，方涣涣兮。\n士与女，方秉蕑兮。\n女曰观乎？士曰既且，且往观乎？\n洧之外，洵訏且乐。\n维士与女，伊其相谑，赠之以勺药。\n溱与洧，浏其清矣。\n士与女，殷其盈矣。\n女曰观乎？士曰既且，且往观乎？\n洧之外，洵訏且乐。\n维士与女，伊其将谑，赠之以勺药。\n分类：诗经 民谣 春天 爱情\n文学赏析：这首诗好像就是写了一个古代的情人节，或大相亲的场面。诗中交代了时间，初春时节，春水涌流的时节；地点，溱洧之外。\n从大处写起，“殷其盈矣”，参加欢会的青年人之多，不可胜数，可谓熙熙攘攘，茫茫人海。这是下面一对情人相会的大背景。\n从小处落笔，“维士与女，伊其相谑”，从这一对少男少女的偶然相识，到二人相约同行，再到相谑，相赠爱情花，把相亲相爱的全过得进行了艺术化的忠实记录。可以说是一个很唯美的专题纪录片。\n这首诗很美，美在春天；美在爱情。尤其美的是两枝花的俏丽出现：“蕑（兰）”与“勺药”。凭借着这两种芬芳的香草，作品完成了从风俗到爱情的转换，从自然界的春天到人生的青春的转换，也完成了从略写到详写的转换，从“全镜头”到“特写镜头”的转换。要之，兰草与芍药，是支撑起全诗结构的两个支点。\n诗分二章，仅换数字，这种回环往复的叠章式，是民歌特别是“诗三百”这些古老民歌的常见形式，有一种纯朴亲切的风味，自不必言。各章皆可分为两层，前四句是一层，落脚在“蕑”；后八句为一层，落脚在“勺药”。前一层内部其实还包含一个小转换，即自然向人的转换，风景向风俗的转换。诗人以寥寥四句描绘了一幅风景画，也描绘了一幅风俗画，二者息息相关，因为古代社会风俗的形成大多与自然节气有关。诗人唱道：“溱与洧，方涣涣兮。”“涣涣”二字十分传神，表现出一片冰化雪消、桃花春汛、春风骀荡的情景。春天，真的已经降临到郑国大地。在这幅春意盎然的风景画中，人出现了：“士与女，方秉蕑兮”。人们经过一个冬天严寒的困扰，冰雪的封锁，从蛰伏般的生活状态中苏醒过来，到野外，到水滨，去欢迎春天的光临。而人手一束的嫩绿兰草，便是这次春游的收获，是春的象征。“招魂续魄，拂除不详”，似乎有点神秘，其实其精神内核应是对肃杀的冬气的告别，对新春万事吉祥如意的祈盼。任何虚幻的宗教意识，都生自现实生活的真切愿望。在这里，从自然到人、风景到风俗的转换，是通过“溱与洧”和“士与女”两个结构相同的句式的转换实现的。结构相同的东西可以使人产生由此及彼的对照、联想，因而这里的转换顺理成章，毫不突然。\n如果说对于成年的“士与女”，他们对新春的祈愿只是风调雨顺，万事如意，那么对于年青的“士与女”，他们的祈愿则更加上一个重要内容——爱情，因为他们不仅拥有大自然的春天，还拥有生命的春天——青春。于是作品便从风俗转向爱情，从“蕑”转向“勺药”。这首诗是以善于转折为人称道的，清人牛运震《诗志》、陈继揆《读诗臆补》皆认为它“妙于用虚字转折”。其实它的“转折之妙”，不仅独在虚字。如上所说，前一层次的从风景向风俗的小转折，是借重两个结构相同的句式实现的。这里从风俗到爱情的大转折，则巧妙地利用了“士”、“女”的相同字面：前层的“士与女”是泛指，犹如常说的“士女如云”；后层的“士”、“女”则是特指，指人群中某一对青年男女。字面虽同，对象则异。这就使转折完成于不知不觉之间，变换实现于了无痕迹之中。诗意一经转折，诗人便一气直下，一改前面的宏观扫描，将“镜头”对准了这对青年男女，记录下他们的呢喃私语，俏皮调笑，更凸现出他们手中的芍药，这爱的信物，情的象征。总之，兰草“淡出”，芍药“淡入”，情节实现了“蒙太奇”式的转换。\n于是，从溱、洧之滨踏青归来的人群，有的身佩兰草，有的手捧芍药，撒一路芬芳，播一春诗意。\n尽管小小的郑国常常受到大国的侵扰，该国的统治者也并不清明，但对于普普通通的人民来说，这个春天的日子仍使他们感到喜悦与满足，因为他们手中有“蕑”，有“勺药”，有美好生活的憧憬与信心。\n现代译文：溱水洧水长又长，河水流淌向远方。\n\n1.溱（zhēn）、洧（wěi）：郑国两条河名。\n2.方：正。涣涣：河水解冻后奔腾貌。\n3.士与女：此处泛指男男女女。后文“女”“士”则特指其中某青年男女。\n4.方：正。秉：执，拿。蕑（jiān）：一种兰草。又名大泽兰，与山兰有别。\n5.既：已经。且（cú）：同“徂”，去，往。\n6.且：再。\n7.洵（xún）訏（xū）：实在宽广。洵，实在，诚然，确实。訏，大，广阔。\n8.维：发语词。\n9.伊：发语词。相谑：互相调笑。\n10.勺药：即“芍药”，一种香草，与今之木芍药不同。《郑笺》：“其别则送女以勺药，结恩情也。”马瑞辰《毛诗传笺通释》云：“又云‘结恩情’者，以勺与约同声，故假借为结约也。”\n11.浏：水深而清之状。\n12.殷：众多。盈：满。\n13.将：即“相”。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"4861","poet":"先秦
