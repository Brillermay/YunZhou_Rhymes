爱情\n文学赏析：《国风·周南·关雎》这首短小的诗篇，在中国文学史上占据着特殊的位置。它是《诗经》的第一篇，而《诗经》是中国文学最古老的典籍。虽然从性质上判断，一些神话故事产生的年代应该还要早些，但作为书面记载，却是较迟的事情。所以差不多可以说，一翻开中国文学的历史，首先遇到的就是《关雎》。\n当初编纂《诗经》的人，在诗篇的排列上是否有某种用意，这已不得而知。但至少后人的理解，并不认为《关雎》是随便排列在首位的。《论语》中多次提到《诗》（即《诗经》），但作出具体评价的作品，却只有《关雎》一篇，谓之“乐而不淫，哀而不伤”。在他看来，《关雎》是表现“中庸”之德的典范。而汉儒的《毛诗序》又说：“《风》之始也，所以风天下而正夫妇也。故用之乡人焉，用之邦国焉。”这里牵涉到中国古代的一种伦理思想：在古人看来，夫妇为人伦之始，天下一切道德的完善，都必须以夫妇之德为基础。《毛诗序》的作者认为，《关雎》在这方面具有典范意义，所以才被列为“《风》之始”。它可以用来感化天下，既适用于“乡人”即普通百姓，也适用于“邦国”即统治阶层。\n《关雎》的内容其实很单纯，是写一个“君子”对“淑女”的追求，写他得不到“淑女”时心里苦恼，翻来覆去睡不着觉；得到了“淑女”就很开心，叫人奏起音乐来庆贺，并以此让“淑女”快乐。作品中人物的身份十分清楚：“君子”在《诗经》的时代是对贵族的泛称，而且这位“君子”家备琴瑟钟鼓之乐，那是要有相当的地位的。以前常把这诗解释为“民间情歌”，恐怕不对头，它所描绘的应该是贵族阶层的生活。另外，说它是情爱诗当然不错，但恐怕也不是一般的爱情诗。这原来是一首婚礼上的歌曲，是男方家庭赞美新娘、祝颂婚姻美好的。《诗经·国风》中的很多歌谣，都是既具有一般的抒情意味、娱乐功能，又兼有礼仪上的实用性，只是有些诗原来派什么用处后人不清楚了，就仅当作普通的歌曲来看待。把《关雎》当作婚礼上的歌来看，从“窈窕淑女，君子好逑”，唱到“琴瑟友之”“钟鼓乐之”，也是喜气洋洋的，很合适的，\n当然这首诗本身，还是以男子追求女子的情歌的形态出现的。之所以如此，大抵与在一般婚姻关系中男方是主动的一方有关。就是在现代，一个姑娘看上个小伙，也总要等他先开口，古人更是如此。娶个新娘回来，夸她是个美丽又贤淑的好姑娘，是君子的好配偶，说自己曾经想她想得害了相思病，必定很讨新娘的欢喜。然后在一片琴瑟钟鼓之乐中，彼此的感情相互靠近，美满的婚姻就从这里开了头。即使单从诗的情绪结构来说，从见关雎而思淑女，到结成琴瑟之好，中间一番周折也是必要的：得来不易的东西，才特别可贵，特别让人高兴。\n这首诗可以被当作表现夫妇之德的典范，主要是由于有这些特点：首先，它所写的爱情，一开始就有明确的婚姻目的，最终又归结于婚姻的美满，不是青年男女之问短暂的邂逅、一时的激情。这种明确指向婚姻、表示负责任的爱情，更为社会所赞同。其次，它所写的男女双方，乃是“君子”和“淑女”，表明这是一种与美德相联系的结合。“君子”是兼有地位和德行双重意义的，而“窈窕淑女”，也是兼说体貌之美和德行之善。这里“君子”与“淑女”的结合，代表了一种婚姻理想。再次，是诗歌所写恋爱行为的节制性。细读可以注意到，这诗虽是写男方对女方的追求，但丝毫没有涉及双方的直接接触。“淑女”固然没有什么动作表现出来，“君子”的相思，也只是独自在那里“辗转反侧”，什么攀墙折柳之类的事情，好像完全不曾想到，爱得很守规矩。这样一种恋爱，既有真实的颇为深厚的感情（这对情诗而言是很重要的），又表露得平和而有分寸，对于读者所产生的感动，也不致过于激烈。以上种种特点，恐怕确实同此诗原来是贵族婚礼上的歌曲有关，那种场合，要求有一种与主人的身份地位相称的有节制的欢乐气氛。而孔子从中看到了一种具有广泛意义的中和之美，借以提倡他所尊奉的自我克制、重视道德修养的人生态度，《毛诗序》则把它推许为可以“风天下而正夫妇”的道德教材。这两者视角有些不同，但在根本上仍有一致之处。\n古之儒者重视夫妇之德，有其很深的道理。在第一层意义上说，家庭是社会组织的基本单元，在古代，这一基本单元的和谐稳定对于整个社会秩序的和谐稳定，意义至为重大。在第二层意义上，所谓“夫妇之德”，实际兼指有关男女问题的一切方面。“饮食男女，人之大欲存焉”（《礼记·礼运》），孔子也知道这是人类生存的基本要求。饮食之欲比较简单（当然首先要有饭吃），而男女之欲引起的情绪活动要复杂、活跃、强烈得多，它对生活规范、社会秩序的潜在危险也大得多，孔子也曾感叹：“吾未见好德如好色者。”（《论语》）所以一切克制、一切修养，都首先要从男女之欲开始。这当然...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1","poet":"先秦
