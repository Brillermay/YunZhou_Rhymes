怀人 讽刺\n文学赏析：此诗是《大雅》的最后一篇，它的主题，《毛诗序》以为是“凡伯刺幽王大坏也”，与前一篇《大雅·瞻卬》的解题一字不异。这种情况在《毛诗序》中并不多见，说明《召旻》与《瞻卬》的内容是有关联的。从诗的开头看，读者多少也能发现一些共同点，《瞻卬》首两句是“瞻卬昊天，则不我惠”，仰望茫茫上空，慨叹老天没有恩情，《召旻》首两句是“昊天疾威，天笃降丧”，悲呼老天暴虐难当，不断降下灾祸，两者语气十分相似，只是《召旻》的口吻更激切一些。周幽王宠幸褒姒，斥逐忠良，致使国家濒于灭亡，所以诗人作《瞻卬》一诗刺之；周幽王又任用奸佞，败坏朝纲，这与宠幸褒姒一样对国家造成极大危害，所以诗人再作《召旻》一诗刺之。\n此篇共七章，句式基本为四字句，但也有三字句、五字句、六字句乃至七字句穿插其间。首章一开始就责天，责天实际上并不是简单的指斥。因为周人的天命观已有天人感应的色彩，国家的最高统治者天子的所作所为会影响天的意志，天子政治清明，自然风调雨顺，天子昏庸暴虐，天就会降下各种自然灾害；所以“天笃降丧”必然是天子缺德的结果。这样，百姓受饥馑荼毒，流离失所，即使在边僻之地也遭灾荒的惨象马上就攫住了读者的心，使之受到强烈的震撼，为受难的民众而悲悯，并由此去思索上天为何降罪于世人。\n第二章逐渐进入主题。“天降罪罟”义同上章的“天笃降丧”，变易其词反覆陈说老天不仁，当然仍是意在斥王。这一句与前一篇《瞻卬》的“天之降罔（网）”也是同义的，这多少也可见出两章内容上的相关性。然“蟊贼内讧”，勾心斗角，败坏朝纲，是昏王纵容的结果，已与上章所说天降之灾带来饥馑流亡全然不同，这也可见“天降罪罟”实在的意思应是“王施恶政”。“昏椓靡共，溃溃回遹”二句，所用的语词虽然今人不很熟悉，但在当时却是很有生命力的词汇。痛斥奸佞小人乱糟糟地互相谗毁伤害，不认真供职，昏愦邪僻尽做坏事，已经是咬牙切齿的愤恨，但这还不够，于是最后再加上一句：“实靖夷我邦”——这是要把我们好好一个国家给葬送掉啊！读到此处，读者仿佛可以看到诗人的心在淌血。\n在上章不遗余力地痛斥奸人之后，第三章诗人从另一个角度继续进行抨击，并感叹自己职位太低无法遏制他们的气焰。上章有带叠字词的“溃溃回遹”句，这章更进一步又用了两个双叠字词组“皋皋訿訿”、“兢兢业业”，一毁一誉，对比鲜明，不啻有天壤之别。“曾不知其玷”，问那些小人怎么会不知道他们的缺点？可谓明知故问，是在上一章强弓硬弩般的正面进攻之后转为匕首短剑般的旁敲侧击，虽方式不同，但照样刺得很深。而“我位孔贬”又糅入了诗人的身世之感，这种身世之感不是单纯的位卑权微之叹，而是与伤幽王宠信奸人败坏政事的家国之恨密不可分的。身为士大夫，哪怕是地位最低的那一层次，也有尽心竭力讽谏规劝君王改恶从善的责任与义务，这虽尚不如后来顾炎武所标举的“天下兴亡，匹夫有责”的精神境界那么高，却也不乏时代的光辉了。\n第四章的描写又回应第一章，以天灾喻人祸。引人注意的是两个“如彼……”句式，一般来说，下一个“如彼……”句之后，应该也有说明性的文字，但这儿“草不溃茂”既是上承“如彼岁旱”的说明性文字，又是下应“如彼栖苴”的说明性文字。也就是说，照例是“如彼岁旱，草不溃茂；如彼栖苴，草不溃茂”的完整句式缩掉了一句，但此种缩略并不影响语义，反而使文势更具跌宕之致，这恐怕也不是诗人有意为之，而是他的妙手偶得。此章末两句“我相此邦，无不溃止”，诗人说：我看这个国家，没有不灭亡的道理！这种写出来的预言恰恰反映出诗人心理上的反预言，痛陈国家必遭灭亡正是为了避免这种灭亡。但历史告诉人们：指出灭亡的趋势并不能使昏君暴君停止倒行逆施，他们对国家形势的觉悟只可能是在遭遇灭亡之后，但遭遇灭亡便是终结，觉悟便也毫无意义；忠臣义士的劝谏对此种历史过程向来是无能为力的，他们的所作所为，无非是为历史中黯淡的一幕幕抹上一丝悲壮的色彩罢了。\n第五章诗人作起了今昔对比，前面两句，是颇工整的对偶，这两句也有人点作四句，“不如时”、“不如兹”单独成句，亦可。“富”与“疚”的反差令人伤心，更令人对黑暗现实产生强烈的憎恨，于是诗人再一次针砭那些得势的小人，“彼疏斯粺，胡不自替”，斥责别人吃粗粮他们吃细粮，却尽干坏事，不肯退位让贤。这两句令人想起《魏风·伐檀》的名句：“彼君子兮，不素餐兮。”\n第六章开头四句也是对偶，是全诗仅有的比兴句（...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1728","poet":"先秦
