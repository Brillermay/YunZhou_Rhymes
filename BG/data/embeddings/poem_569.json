长诗 叙事 妇女 奴隶\n文学赏析：豳地在今陕西旬邑、彬县一带，公刘时代周之先民还是一个农业部落。《豳风·七月》反映了这个部落一年四季的劳动生活，涉及到衣食住行各个方面，它的作者当是部落中的成员，所以口吻酷肖，角度极准，从各个侧面展示了当时社会的风俗画，凡春耕、秋收、冬藏、采桑、染绩、缝衣、狩猎、建房、酿酒、劳役、宴飨，无所不写。\n诗从七月写起，按农事活动的顺序，以平铺直叙的手法，逐月展开各个画面。诗中使用的是周历。周历以夏历（今之农历，一称阴历）的十一月为正月，七月、八月、九月、十月以及四、五、六月，皆与夏历相同。“一之日”、“二之日”、“三之日”、“四之日”，即夏历的十一月、十二月、一月、二月。“蚕月”，即夏历的三月。戴震《毛郑诗考证》指出：周时虽改为周正（以农历十一月为正月岁首），但民间农事仍沿用夏历。\n首章以鸟瞰式的手法，概括了劳动者全年的生活，向读者展示了那个凄苦艰辛的岁月。同时它也为以后各章奠定了基调，提示了总纲。朱熹《诗集传》云：“此章前段言衣之始，后段言食之始。二章至五章，终前段之意。六章至八章，终后段之意。”在结构上如此安排，确是相当严谨。所谓“衣之始”、“食之始”，实际上指农业社会中耕与织两大主要事项。这两项是贯穿全篇的主线。首章是说九月里妇女“桑麻之事已毕，始可为衣”。十一月以后便进入朔风凛冽的冬天，农夫们连粗布衣衫也没有一件，怎么能度过年关，故而发出“何以卒岁”的哀叹。可是春天一到，他们又整理农具到田里耕作。老婆孩子则到田头送饭，田官见他们劳动很卖力，不由得面露喜色。民间诗人以粗线条勾勒了一个框架，当时社会生活的整体风貌已呈现在读者面前。以后各章便从各个侧面、各个局部进行较为细致的刻画。\n诗的二、三章情调逐渐昂扬，色调逐渐鲜明。明媚的春光照着田野，莺声呖呖。背着筐儿的妇女，结伴儿沿着田间小路去采桑。她们的劳动似乎很愉快，但心中不免怀有隐忧：“女心伤悲，殆及公子同归。”首章“田唆至喜”，只是以轻轻的一笔点到了当时社会的阶级关系，这里便慢慢地加以展开。“公子”，论者多谓豳公之子。豳公占有大批土地和农奴，他的儿子们对农家美貌女子也享有与其“同归”的特权。汉乐府《秋胡行》和《陌上桑》诗中似乎有这样的影子，虽然那是千年以后的事，但生活中的规律往往也会出现某些相似的地方。姑娘们的美貌使她们担心人身的不自由；姑娘们的灵巧和智慧，也使她们担心劳动果实为他人所占有：“八月载绩，载玄载黄，我朱孔阳，为公子裳。”她们织出五颜六色的丝绸，都成了公子身上的衣裳，正如宋人张俞的《蚕妇》诗所说：“遍身罗绮者，不是养蚕人。”\n四、五两章虽从“衣之始”一条线发展而来，但亦有发展变化。“秀葽”、“鸣蜩”，带有起兴之意，下文重点写狩猎。他们打下的狐狸，要“为公子裘”；他们打下的大猪，要贡献给豳公，自己只能留下小的吃。这里再一次描写了当时的阶级关系。五章着重写昆虫以反映季节的变化，由蟋蟀依人写到寒之将至，笔墨工细，绘影绘声，饶有诗意。《诗集传》云：“斯螽、莎鸡、蟋蟀，一物随时变化而异其名。动股，始跃而以股鸣也。振羽，能飞而以翅鸣也。”咏物之作，如此细腻，令人惊叹。“穹窒熏鼠”以下四句，写农家打扫室内，准备过冬，在结构上“亦以终首章前段御寒之意”。\n六、七、八章，承“食之始”一条线而来，好像一组连续的电影镜头，表现了农家朴素而安详的生活：六、七月里他们“食郁（郁李）及薁”、“亨（烹）葵（葵菜）及菽（豆子）”。七、八月里，他们打枣子，割葫芦。十月里收下稻谷，酿制春酒，给老人祝寿。可是粮食刚刚进仓，又得给老爷们营造公房，与上面所写的自己的居室的破烂简陋适成鲜明对比。“筑场圃”、“纳禾稼”，写一年农事的最...","metadata":{"poem_id":"569","poet":"先秦
