李白\n正文：朝作猛虎行，暮作猛虎吟。\n肠断非关陇头水，泪下不为雍门琴。\n旌旗缤纷两河道，战鼓惊山欲倾倒。\n秦人半作燕地囚，胡马翻衔洛阳草。\n一输一失关下兵，朝降夕叛幽蓟城。\n巨鳌未斩海水动，鱼龙奔走安得宁。\n颇似楚汉时，翻覆无定止。\n朝过博浪沙，暮入淮阴市。\n张良未遇韩信贫，刘项存亡在两臣。\n暂到下邳受兵略，来投漂母作主人。\n贤哲栖栖古如此，今时亦弃青云士。\n有策不敢犯龙鳞，窜身南国避胡尘。\n宝书长剑挂高阁，金鞍骏马散故人。\n昨日方为宣城客，掣铃交通二千石。\n有时六博快壮心，绕床三匝呼一掷。\n楚人每道张旭奇，心藏风云世莫知。\n三吴邦伯多顾盼，四海雄侠皆相推。\n萧曹曾作沛中吏，攀龙附凤当有时。\n溧阳酒楼三月春，杨花漠漠愁杀人。\n胡人绿眼吹玉笛，吴歌白纻飞梁尘。\n丈夫相见且为乐，槌牛挝鼓会众宾。\n我从此去钓东海，得鱼笑寄情相亲。\n分类：乐府 忧国忧民\n文学赏析：全诗共分三段。从开始至“鱼龙奔走安得宁”为第一段，叙述安禄山攻占东都洛阳，劫掠中原的暴行及诗人眼见河山破碎，社稷危亡，生灵涂炭，忧心如焚的思想感情。诗中将安禄山叛军比做吃人的猛虎。对安史叛乱，大唐帝国危在旦夕的局势，诗人十分焦虑。他肠断泪下，不是因为古乐府歌辞“陇头流水，鸣声幽咽，遥望秦川，心肝断绝”的忧伤曲调勾起了他的故乡之思；也并非因为听了像战国时的音乐家雍门子周那样的高手所弹的凄楚动人的琴声而触动了他个人的伤心之事。而是为国家的安危，人民的灾难痛哭。以下八句写胡兵掳掠洛阳，时局混乱，国衰民亡的惨状，亦即诗人伤心的原因。“旌旗缤纷两河道，战鼓惊山欲倾倒。”安禄山叛乱时，河北道、河南道相继陷落，被胡人所占领。安禄山攻破洛阳后，朝廷派大将高仙芝率兵至陕州（今河南三门峡市）抵抗，被安史乱军所败，成了安禄山的俘虏，因为他的部下多是关中人（即秦人），禄山的军队多是燕人，因此说“ 秦人半为燕地囚”； 东都陷落，胡骑遍于市郊，故而说“胡马翻衔洛阳草” 。\n“ 一输一失关下兵” ，是指高仙芝因兵败于安禄山（故云“一输”），明皇闻此大怒，命宦官边令诚斩高仙芝于军中。高仙芝不战而退，退守潼关，乃出于保卫长安的战略考虑，而唐明皇听信宦官谗言，草率杀掉干城大将，是极失策的（故云“一失”）。“关下兵”，指退守潼关的军队。至德元年（756年）十二月，常山太守颜杲卿起兵讨贼，河北十七郡皆归朝廷，等到颜杲卿被安史乱军攻陷，河北诸郡又复归贼手，故云“朝降夕叛”。“幽蓟城”指唐河北道的幽州、蓟州（均在今河北、辽宁地区）等地的城池。安史乱军如海中的巨鳌，搅得海水翻滚，以致海中的鱼龙（指唐朝的军民百姓）奔走不宁，此所谓：“巨鳌未斩海水动，鱼龙奔走安得宁？”第一段将洛阳沦陷后敌焰猖狂，天下罹乱的情景及诗人忧心如焚的心情，生动形象地刻画出来。\n从“颇似楚汉时”至“绕床三匝呼一掷”为第二段。此段借张良、韩信未遇的故事，抒发诗人身遭乱世，不为昏庸的统治者任用，虽胸怀“王霸大略”、匡世济民之术，也无处施展，无奈随逃难的人群“窜身南国”的感慨。安史乱军来势凶猛，东都洛阳很快沦陷，战争的局势颇似楚汉相争时，呈拉锯状态。这使李白联想起历史上决定汉朝命运的杰出的谋臣和大将——张良和韩信来。他们在未遭君臣际遇之时，境况也与自己目前的状况差不多。张良在博浪沙椎击秦始皇，误中副车，被秦追捕，他只能更名改姓，亡命下邳（今江苏邳县），在下邳圮上遇黄石公，授他《太公兵法》。韩信最初在淮阴（今江苏淮阴）市曾受市井无赖的胯下之辱，无以为生，钓于城下。受漂絮的老妇的饭食充饥。后来韩信投汉，汉高祖一开始也未重用他，他月夜逃亡，演了一出“萧何月下追韩信”。\n像张良和韩信这样的贤才智士，尚且有困顿不遇之时，像汉高祖那样的明君，还有不明之时，“今时亦弃青云士”就不足为怪了。李白在安史之乱未发前，就曾单身匹马闯幽州，探安禄山虚实。公元754年（天宝十三年）曾三入长安，欲向朝廷报告安禄山欲反叛的情状，无奈唐玄宗十分昏聩，凡是告安禄山欲反的人，都被送给安禄山发落。李白因此“有策不敢犯龙鳞，窜身南国避胡尘”了。传说龙的颈下有逆鳞径尺，若触动他的逆鳞，则必怒而伤人，这里以此喻皇帝喜怒无常，不喜听批评意见，暗示唐玄宗、肃宗决非是汉高祖那样的贤君明主。愤慨之馀，诗人只好“宝书玉剑挂高阁，金鞍骏马散故人”。表面上看起来是很旷达，其实所表达的是对朝廷不用贤才的深切愤懑。诗人无事可做，只好在诸侯门里做客。刚刚在宣城太守家里做筵上客，此时又在溧阳府上当座上宾。自己的满腔豪情和壮志无处抒发，唯有在赌博场中吆五喝六，搏髀大呼，以快壮心，一吐愤懑。\n从“楚人每道张旭奇”至诗末为第三段。前六句盛赞大书法家张旭的才能和为人，后六句写在溧阳酒楼和众宾客及张旭饮宴的情景，最后两句写自己欲钓鳌东海的胸襟和抱负，表达自己壮志未已，仍旧伺机报国立功的思想。张旭是李白的好友，在长安时，他们曾与贺知章、崔宗之等人有过“饮中八仙”之游。\n张旭不但因善书被尊为“草...","metadata":{"poem_id":"328","poet":"唐代
