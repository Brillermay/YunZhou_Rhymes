王勃\n正文：落花落，落花纷漠漠。\n绿叶青跗映丹萼，与君裴回上金阁。\n影拂妆阶玳瑁筵，香飘舞馆茱萸幕。\n落花飞，燎乱入中帷。\n落花春正满，春人归不归。\n落花度，氛氲绕高树。\n落花春已繁，春人春不顾。\n绮阁青台静且闲，罗袂红巾复往还。\n盛年不再得，高枝难重攀。\n试复旦游落花里，暮宿落花间。\n与君落花院，台上起双鬟。\n分类：春天 写花 伤怀 青春\n创作背景：十八岁的时候，王勃在沛王李贤府中侍读。戏作《檄英王鸡》文，被高宗怒逐出府。\n这件事情对王勃的打击，就像满园怒放的花，经历了一场狂风暴雨。\n从此，王勃，便如一朵落花，开始了他坠落的姿态。\n“顿忘山岳，坎坷于唐尧之朝；傲想烟霞，憔悴于圣明之代。”他替自己的命运愁苦。然而山岳，烟霞，早已是自古文人生命中的一部分，岂是说忘就能忘的么？\n王勃是傲的，因为一旦一件事情在某个人的心中变得神圣，又怎能容许别人轻易亵渎？王勃心中，那凛然不可侵的东西是什么？\n22岁时，因为“擅杀官奴”，王勃被判了死罪。\n王勃的父亲被牵连，贬官至交趾令。\n逢了大赦，王勃免了死罪。于是 他猛然明白了光阴，明白了落花，便有了这首落花之作。\n文学赏析：这是一首伤春之作，有种春伤的情怀。所谓春伤，就是人在美好的意境中年华老去，回首还似在梦中的意思。人还沉浸在美好的青春年华，却不知青春已渐远去。 亦是花儿落下变得冷漠无情！离人而去！\n首先，诗人从最显眼的色彩入笔，完全符合人的审美途径，容易引起共鸣，“绿叶青跗映丹萼， 与君裴回上金合。”这两句话，着重描绘色彩。诗中的色彩是鲜艳欲滴的，如：“绿叶”，“青跗”，“丹萼”。而且从“叶”，“跗”，“萼”，这三者次序依次上升，宛如你正在赏花，目光逐渐上移。然而画不是静态的，一副色彩鲜艳华丽会动的画面。“映”字点出色彩的互衬互溶，暗示了花朵衬在绿叶里在风中摇曳。着这样的如梦如幻意境下，作者和友人一起游赏金碧辉煌的楼阁。\n“影拂妆阶玳瑁筵，香飘舞馆茱萸幕”。“玳瑁筵”，亦称玳筵,指精美的筵席。“茱萸幕”指的是绘有茱萸或者插满茱萸的幕帘。色泽上玳瑁筵和茱萸幕已经占尽优势。诗人再从动态上描述：“香飘”，“影拂”中香和影都是抽象的，需要心领神会的。飘和拂都是细微的动作，这些意动的描写，体现了作者心神放松，神气宜然。敏锐的捕捉到香气和烂漫变换。\n看着色彩艳丽的落花，让人心情变得美好，于是将花丛的色泽实化为玳瑁筵，将花香说成是帘幕随风舞动而成。从而在神态和形态上把握住了春天的内涵，达到了一种轻松愉悦的心态。\n这种灵敏的诗性和杨巨源的“诗家清景在新春，绿柳才黄半未匀。”是一样的，但是诗人的描绘则更为鲜艳华贵，具有孩童般的率真，更带有浓浓的春的气息。\n这里指的注意的是，每句诗中，作者都用的两个动词。若说飘和拂都是细微的，妆和舞则是彻彻底底在作者感受到春的神意后内心激动恣意狂放的喜悦了。妆和舞的是外物也何尝不是诗人自己整束衣冠，载歌载舞呢？\n落花落，落花随风飞舞，漫天的花瓣，在风中舞得缭乱，显现了千万种舞姿，落花如痴如醉，如梦如幻，随风飘进了屋子，在飘飘的帷幔中飞舞，又如人生终于舞作了一生中最美的姿态。\n“落花春正满，春人归不归。”归不归？ 满是疑问，其实早有了解答。 便如那岁岁荣枯的花，自有其归宿。\n“试复旦游落花里，暮宿落花间。”那花树一身香气，如那人，满襟的花瓣，一脸的春愁，令人陶醉。此时春已繁，繁到了极点，仿佛春花便要落尽。诗人便在这绚烂而忧伤的落花季节，与知已友人一起了结同心。\n现代译文：\n\n\n（1）跗（fū
