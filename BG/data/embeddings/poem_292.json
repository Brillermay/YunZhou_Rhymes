李白\n正文：桃李待日开，荣华照当年。\n东风动百物，草木尽欲言。\n枯枝无丑叶，涸水吐清泉。\n大力运天地，羲和无停鞭。\n功名不早著，竹帛将何宣。\n桃李务青春，谁能贳白日。\n富贵与神仙，蹉跎成两失。\n金石犹销铄，风霜无久质。\n畏落日月后，强欢歌与酒。\n秋霜不惜人，倏忽侵蒲柳。\n分类：写花 抒怀\n文学赏析：李白这首《长歌行》深受同题古辞的影响。长歌行古辞或写及时建功立业，不要老大伤悲；或写游仙服药，延年长寿；或写游子思乡，感伤人命短促。陆机《长歌行》恨功名薄，竹帛无宣；谢灵运《长歌行》感时光流速，壮志消磨；梁元帝《长歌行》写及时行乐；沈约《长歌行》写羁旅行后倦恋金华殿，功名未著，竹帛难宣。总之李白之前运用长歌行古题者，均触景感时，抒写悲伤之情，寄寓着他们对美好人生的追求，以及追求不得的怅惘感伤的心灵。李白由此感悟人生，联想反思自己功业无成，游仙不果，重蹈古人的覆辙，陷入痛苦之中，不抒不快。于是尽情倾吞，激昂文字，悲歌式的心灵，融汇着千古人所共有的情愫，感发着人意，体验着人生的苦乐。\n此诗前十句为第一段。开端两句，总述桃李迎春得朝阳而鲜花怒放，争芳吐艳，然而它也只是荣华当年。一年一度春芳桃李，这是自然规律，因而桃李花开是春天的象征，是美好的象征。经过幽闭冬藏的寒日笼照之后，转而接受春日温暖的朝阳抚摸，使大地万物顿感复苏，呈现了活跃的旺盛的生命力，作为万物之灵的人，精神倍增，昂扬奋进，这是物之常理与人之常情。故人们把人生美好时刻称之为青春。可是作者认知不限于此，而更深入探索桃李迎春吐艳，其条件是须春阳细腻的化育，苦心无私地用功，生存发展离不开春日阳光。由此作者更悟出君臣关系的相互依存的道理，预伏后面“功名不早著”之因。日这个描写意象在古诗中曾有象征君王之意。桃李遇春阳而开，贤相逢明君而荣，自然常律与人事常理，有其相似之点，明写桃李，暗喻君臣事理。这可能是用“得日开”的甘苦用心吧!美好意象的描写，深含着美好感情与对美好事物的追求。美虽美；但尤感不足之处，只是荣华当年，因而更值得珍惜。接着作者连用四句诗赞美春光之妙用，“东风动百物，草木尽欲言。枯枝无丑叶，涸水吐清芬。”东风送暖，遍吹大地万物，阳气萌发，万物从蛰伏中苏醒，争现新姿，构成了一个生命律动的美的境界。因而草木尽欲显露英姿，冬日的枯枝丑叶败落净尽。“无丑叶”的对应之意是“竟美叶”。已经乾涸的水泉，也喷吐着清香的水柱。这四句从开端的桃李花开一点，铺叙春回大地的全景。桃李艳美又衬托东风不停地化育万物，草木换新颜，涸泉复吐清芬，尽现出春之美，写出春之境界。总上六句诗正是诗人触景所生之美感，又以平淡自然的文字与诗句，绘成春光美的形象与意境，诗人入于境中，而又出于境外，妙笔生花，与境冥合。于平淡的描写中凝聚着深蕴美与哲理性认知，然而它绝不同于自然教科书的说理。这一段后四句则由上面春光境界的描写而转入讨论，发抒感慨，寻求造成这一美景的力量来源。“大力运天地，羲和无停鞭。功名不早著，竹帛将何宣。”作者依据中国古代哲学家见解，也认为这是自然界的神力，运转天地，故而有春、夏、秋、冬四季，因而也就生成了宇宙中万物的自然生存、发展、死亡的各自规律，形成了不同季节的不同景象。不过人们总是偏爱春日，而厌恶冬日，不过这是当时人们无法改变这一阴阳变化的规律。当然他们也从天地运行不止，时光流速，永无停止中，观察万物的生衰，包括人的生老病死，悟出了一个人生道理，人亦应如春日桃李花一样，要在青春的美好时刻，展示怀抱，建立丰功伟业。生时为人们仰慕赞美，死后美名留青史，千古流芳。可是在现实中的李白，虽有美好的理想和作人的价值观，以及奋进不止的精神，但由于得不到“日”（皇帝）的温暖抚育，年华老大，驾着六龙的日神车，驭手羲和又催赶不停，如不能在青春时早立功名，就更不能留名于竹帛的史书之中。默默无闻地离开人世，故深为痛恨。外在的无形压力与内在愤激之情的积郁，终于迸发出忧患不平的心声。从过去的借鉴，目前的现状，到未来的预测，拓展时空，言浅而意深，雅正而浑厚，发展了五言古诗的传统特点。诗写到这里诗情与意旨都该停顿，但留给人们的是为何功名不早立，结局又是如何的悬念。\n诗的后十句为第二段。头两句照应开端，深化诗意。桃李既然是专在追求青春，应青春而显美容。那么有人能赊取太阳，使其不动，青春不是永在吗？“谁”字有疑问之情，本是不能之事，设想其能，从幻想中慰勉自己，从幻境中享受快感，从而减轻了心里压力，从困境得到解脱。然而幻想是暂时的，当其转化为现实之时，也就从狂热转化为冷静，用理智滤取生活的轨迹，明确是非与得失，于是铸成“富贵与神仙，蹉跎两相失”的痛定思痛的诗句。对于自己的言行作出了新的判断，知昨日之非。追求富贵功名，神仙长生，这是统治阶级的享乐意识和人生价值观。当了官是实现人生价值的标志，自然富而且贵。于此又滋生长生不死的幻想和妄求，目的永远保持自己的权贵地位与富裕的生活条件，名与利两收。求官不得则游仙...","metadata":{"poem_id":"292","poet":"唐代
