女子\n文学赏析：《思齐》全诗二十四句，毛传将其分为五章，前两章每章六句，后三章每章四句。郑玄作笺，将其改为四章，每章均为六句。相比较而言，毛传的划分更为合理，故后代大多从之。\n首章六句，赞美了三位女性，即“周室三母”：文王祖母周姜（太姜）、文王生母大任（太任）和文王妻子大姒（太姒）。但其叙述顺序却并非按世系进行，而是先母亲，再祖母，后妻子。孙鑛对此分析道：“本重在太姒，却从太任发端，又逆推上及太姜，然后以‘嗣徽音’实之，极有波折。若顺下，便味短。”（陈子展《诗经直解》引）说此章“重在太姒”似可商榷，但言其“极有波折”尚可一听。马瑞辰对此亦曰：“按‘思齐’四句平列。首二句言大任，次二句言大姜。末二句‘大姒嗣徽音’，乃言大姒兼嗣大姜大任之德耳。古人行文自有错综，不必以思媚周姜为大任思爱大姜配大王之礼也。”（《毛诗传笺通释》）\n《毛诗序》谓此诗主旨是“文王所以圣也”，孔颖达疏曰：“作《思齐》诗者，言文王所以得圣由其贤母所生。文王自天性当圣，圣亦由母大贤，故歌咏其母，言文王之圣有所以而然也。”欧阳修亦曰：“文王所以圣者，世有贤妃之助。”（《诗本义》）按此之意，文王是由于得到其母其妻之助而圣，所以此诗赞美“文王所以圣”即是赞美周室三母。但整首诗只有首章言及周室三母，其余四章片言未提，正如严粲所云：“谓文王之所以得圣由其贤母所生，止是首章之意耳。”（《诗缉》）毛传和郑笺是将首章之意作为全诗之旨了。其实此诗赞美的对象还是文王，赞美的是“文王之圣”，而非“文王之所以圣”。首章只是全诗的引子，全诗的发端，重心还在以下四章。\n二章六句，包含两层意思。前三句承上而来，言文王孝敬祖先，故祖神无怨无痛，保佑文王。后三句言文王以身作则于妻子，使妻子也像自己那样为德所化；然后又作表率于兄弟，使兄弟也为德所化；最后再推及到家族邦国中去。这三句颇有“修身、齐家、治国、平天下”的意味。毛传将此章第四句“刑于寡妻”的“刑”训作“法”，郑玄笺曰：“文王以礼法接待其妻，至于宗族。”除此诗外，“刑”在《诗经》中还出现五次，共有两种解释：一为名词的“法”，一为动词的“效法”。此诗的“刑”是动词，所以还是解释“效法”为好，况且郑玄所说的“礼法”是后起的概念，恐非文王时就有。“刑于寡妻”即“效法于寡妻”，也就是“被寡妻所效法”，所以“刑”逐渐又引申为“型”，即典型、模范，此诗用的就是这个意思。\n从第三章开始，每章由六句转为四句。第三章的前两句承上章的后三句而来，以文王在家庭与在宗庙为典型环境，言其处处以身作则，为人表率。后两句“不显亦临，无射亦保”进一步深化主题。“不显”一词在《诗经》中还有十一见，其中十处作“丕显”（即很显明）解，唯有《大雅·抑》“无日不显，莫予云觏”作“昏暗、不明亮”解，意即：莫说因为这里光线昏暗而无人能看见我。朱熹《诗集传》释曰：“无日此非显明之处，而莫予见也。当知鬼神之妙，无物不体，其至于是，有不可得而测者。”此诗的“不显”亦是这个意思。《诗集传》释此句曰：“不显，幽隐之处也……（文王）虽居幽隐，亦常若有临之者。”也就是说此句意谓：文王即使身处幽隐之处，亦是小心翼翼，而不为所欲为，因为他觉得再幽隐的地方也有神灵的眼睛在注视着。此处甚有后代“慎独”的意味。第四句的“无射”在《诗经》中凡三见，其他二处均作“无斁”解，此处恐亦不例外。“无斁”是无厌不倦之意。“无射亦保”的“保”即《大雅·烝民》“既明且哲，以保其身”的“保”，全句谓文王孜孜不倦地保持美好的节操。\n如果说第三章言文王“修身”的话，那么最后两章就是“治国”了，所以方玉润说：“末二章承上‘家邦’推广言之。”（《诗经原始》）第四章的前两句“肆戎疾不殄，烈假不瑕”，谓文王好善修德，所以天下太平，外无西戎之患，内无病灾之忧。诸家有关“瑕”、“殄”二字的解释五花八门，繁不胜繁。其实这二字意义相近，《尚书·康诰》有“不汝瑕殄”，“瑕”“殄”并称，孔安国传曰：“我不汝罪过，不绝亡汝。”可见二字均有伤害、灭绝之义。第四章后两句“不闻亦式，不谏亦入”各家的解释亦是五花八门，越说越糊涂，还是《诗集传》说得最简单明了：“虽事之无所前闻者，而亦无不合于法度。虽无谏诤之者，而亦未尝不入于善。”\n最后一章不难理解，主要讲文王勤于培养人才，只是最后一句“誉髦斯士”，稍有争议。高亨《诗经今注》说：“‘誉髦斯士’，当作‘誉斯髦士’，‘斯髦’二字传写误倒。《小雅·甫田》：‘燕我髦士。’《大雅·棫朴》：‘髦士攸宜。’都是髦士连文，可证。”其实不必这样推断。“誉”是好的意思，“髦”是俊的意思，在此均用作动词...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1450","poet":"先秦
