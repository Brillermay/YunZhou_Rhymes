刘希夷\n正文：洛阳城东桃李花，飞来飞去落谁家？\n洛阳女儿惜颜色，坐见落花长叹息。\n今年花落颜色改，明年花开复谁在？\n已见松柏摧为薪，更闻桑田变成海。\n古人无复洛城东，今人还对落花风。\n年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同。\n寄言全盛红颜子，应怜半死白头翁。\n此翁白头真可怜，伊昔红颜美少年。\n公子王孙芳树下，清歌妙舞落花前。\n光禄池台文锦绣，将军楼阁画神仙。\n一朝卧病无相识，三春行乐在谁边？\n宛转蛾眉能几时？须臾鹤发乱如丝。\n但看古来歌舞地，唯有黄昏鸟雀悲。\n分类：写花 感伤 青春\n文学赏析：这是一首拟古乐府诗。《白头吟》是汉乐府相和歌楚调曲旧题，古辞写一个女子向遗弃她的情人表示决绝。刘希夷这首诗则从女子写到老翁，咏叹青春易逝、富贵无常。构思独创，抒情宛转，语言优美，音韵和谐，艺术性较高，在初唐即受推崇，历来传为名篇。\n诗的前半写洛阳女子感伤落花，抒发人生短促、红颜易老的感慨；后半写白头老翁遭遇沦落，抒发世事变迁、富贵无常的感慨，以“但看古来歌舞地，惟有黄昏鸟雀悲”总结全篇意旨。在前后的过渡，以“寄言全盛红颜子，应怜半死白头翁”二句，点出红颜女子的未来不免是白头老翁的今日，白头老翁的往昔实即是红颜女子的今日。诗人把红颜女子和白头老翁的具体命运加以典型化，表现出这是一大群处于封建社会下层的男女老少的共同命运，因而提出应该同病相怜，具有“醒世”的作用。\n“洛阳城东桃李花，飞来飞去落谁家”，诗的开头两句，描绘洛阳城东暮春景色。洛阳是唐代的东都，十分繁华；繁华的都市盛开着艳丽的鲜花，满城春色，生气勃勃，令人心醉神往。然而时光易逝，此时的洛阳已是落花季节，桃李纷飞，不知飘向何处。这两句是诗的起兴。下文表达的对大好春光、妙龄红颜的憧憬和留恋，对桃李花落、青春易逝的感伤和惋惜，都是由此生发开来的。\n“洛阳女儿好颜色”以下十句，写年轻的洛阳女儿面对漫天飞舞的落花生出无限感慨。洛阳女儿所感伤的，实际上是由大自然的变化而联想到美的短暂和人的生命的有限。“今年花落颜色改，明年花开复谁在？”表现的是因为春光的流逝而感叹红颜易老、生命无常的心理。“松柏摧为薪”句，出自《古诗十九首·去者日以疏》：“古墓犁为田，松柏摧为薪。”“桑田变成海”，指陆地变成海洋，典出《神仙传·麻姑》：“麻姑自说云，接待以来，已见东海三为桑田。”这两句运用比喻，形象地表现世事变化很大。“古人无复洛城东，今人还对落花风”则揭示人生易逝、宇宙永恒的客观规律。“年年岁岁花相似，岁岁年年人不同”两句，以优美、流畅、工整的对句集中地表现青春易老世事无常的感叹，富于诗的意境，且具有哲理性，历来广为传诵。\n“寄言全盛红颜子”以下十句，概括叙述白头翁一生的经历。白头老翁曾是一个美貌少年，从前他也常和公子王孙一起，在树下花前歌舞游乐。“光禄池台文锦绣”两句，以历史上权臣贵戚的豪华奢侈，表现白头翁曾经历过的一段富贵生活。然而，一旦生病衰老，就无人理睬，三春行乐只好让给别人了。这一段通过描写白头翁从红颜到老病、从游乐到孤苦的生活，不仅表示了诗人对青春红颜、清歌妙舞的眷恋、向往，对垂老白头翁的怜悯、同情，同时进一步抒发了对美的短暂和生命的有限的感慨，从而增强了诗歌的艺术感染力和哲理性。\n结尾四句点明主旨，收束全诗。“宛转蛾眉能几时？须臾鹤发乱如丝”两句感叹美貌的少女转眼之间将化作白发的老妇，惋惜青春难驻。“但看古来歌舞地，唯有黄昏鸟雀悲”两句，一切都如同过眼云烟，迅速消失了！往日繁华热闹的游乐场所，如今只有几只离群的鸟雀在清冷的暮蔼中发出几声凄苦的悲鸣。末句的最后一个“悲”字，是此诗的基调。\n诗的前半首化自东汉宋子侯的乐府歌辞《董娇娆》，但经过刘希夷的再创作，更为概括典型。作为前半的结语，“年年岁岁”二句是精警的名句，它比喻精当，语言精粹，令人警省。“年年岁岁”“岁岁年年”的颠倒重复，不仅排沓回荡，音韵优美，更在于强调了时光流逝的无情事实和听天由命的无奈情绪，真实动情。“花相似”、“人不同”的形象比喻，突出了花卉盛衰有时而人生青春不再的对比，耐人寻味。结合后半写白头老翁的遭遇，可以体会到，诗人不用“女子”和“春花”对比，而用泛指名词“人”和“花”对比，不仅是由于七言诗字数的限制，更由于要包括所有不能掌握自己命运的可怜人，其中也包括了诗人自己。也许，因此产生了不少关于这诗的附会传说。如《大唐新语》《本事诗》所云：诗人自己也觉得这两句诗是一种不祥的预兆，即所谓“诗谶”，一年后，诗人果然被害，应了所谓“诗谶”的说法。这类无稽之谈的产生与流传，既反映人们爱惜诗人的才华，同情他的不幸，也表明这诗情调也过于伤感了。\n此诗融会汉魏歌行、南朝近体及梁、陈宫体的艺术经验，而自成一种清丽婉转的风格。它还汲取乐府诗的叙事间发议论、古诗的以叙事方式抒情的手法，又能巧妙交织运用各种对比，发挥对偶、用典的长处，是这诗艺术上的突出成就。刘希夷生前似未成名，而在死后，孙季良编选《正声集...","metadata":{"poem_id":"3217","poet":"唐代
