佚名\n正文：浩浩昊天，不骏其德。\n降丧饥馑，斩伐四国。\n旻天疾威，弗虑弗图。\n舍彼有罪，既伏其辜。\n若此无罪，沦胥以铺。\n周宗既灭，靡所止戾。\n正大夫离居，莫知我勚。\n三事大夫，莫肯夙夜。\n邦君诸侯，莫肯朝夕。\n庶曰式臧，覆出为恶。\n如何昊天，辟言不信。\n如彼行迈，则靡所臻。\n凡百君子，各敬尔身。\n胡不相畏，不畏于天？戎成不退，饥成不遂。\n曾我暬御，惨惨日瘁。\n凡百君子，莫肯用讯。\n听言则答，谮言则退。\n哀哉不能言，匪舌是出，维躬是瘁。\n哿矣能言，巧言如流，俾躬处休！维曰予仕，孔棘且殆。\n云不何使，得罪于天子；亦云可使，怨及朋友。\n谓尔迁于王都。\n曰予未有室家。\n鼠思泣血，无言不疾。\n昔尔出居，谁从作尔室？\n分类：诗经 写雨 抒情 忧国忧民\n文学赏析：此诗题为“雨无正”，可是，从全篇诗句中，并无“雨多”之意，也无“政多如雨”之言，因而历朝历代很多人都怀疑诗题与诗意不合。有人疑为“雨无止”；有人疑为“周无正”（正，同“政”）；更有人说韩诗有《雨无极》篇，诗文比毛诗篇首多“雨无其极，伤我稼穑”二句。各执一说，莫衷一是。姚际恒《诗经通论》说：“此篇名《雨无正》不可考，或误，不必强论。”\n全诗七章。一、二章章十句，三、四章章八句，五、六、七章章六句，共五十四句，能于参差错落中见整饬。\n诗的第一章首先以无限感慨、无限忧伤的语气，埋怨天命靡常：“不骏其德”，致使丧乱、饥馑和灾难都一起降在人间。但是，真正有罪的人，依然逍遥自在，而广大无罪的人，却蒙受了无限的苦难。这里，表面是埋怨昊天，实际上是借以讽刺幽王。接着，第二章就直接揭示了残酷的现实问题：“周宗既灭，靡所止戾”。可是在这国家破灭、人民丧亡之际，一些王公大臣、公卿大夫们，逃跑的逃跑，躲避的躲避，不仅不能为扶倾救危效力，反而乘机做出各种恶劣的行径。因而，第三章作者就进一步揭示出了造成这次灾祸的根本原因：国王“辟言不信”，一天天胡作非为，不知要把国家引向何处；而“凡百君子”又“不畏于天”，反而助纣为虐，做出了一系列既不自重、又肆无忌惮的坏事。第四章，作者又以沉痛的语言指出：战祸不息，饥荒不止，国事日非，不仅百官“莫肯用讯”，国王也只能听进顺耳的话而拒绝批评，只有他这位侍御小臣在为危难当头的国事而“憯憯日瘁”了。第五章，作者再次申诉自己处境的艰难。由于国王“听言则答，谮言则退”，致使自己“哀哉不能言”，而那些能说会道之徒则口若悬河。自己“维躬是瘁”，而他们却“俾躬处休”。不是自己拙口笨舌，而是国王是非不分、忠奸不辨的行为使自己无法谏诤了。对比鲜明，感情更加深沉。因此，在第六章里，作者又进一步说明了“于仕”的困难和危殆。仕而直道，将得罪天子；仕而枉道，又见怨于朋友。左右为难，忧心如焚。最后一章，作者指出：要劝那些达官贵人迁向王朝的新都吧，他们又以“未有家室”为借口而加以拒绝，加以嫉恨，致使自己无法说话，而只有“鼠思泣血”。其实，他们在国家危难之际，外地虽然没有家室，也照样纷纷逃离了。\n由此可见，这是一首抒情诗。作者面对国破、世危的局面，思前想后，感愤万端。既埋怨天命靡常，又揭露国王信谗拒谏、是非不分。执事大臣或苟且偷安，或花言巧语，致使天灾人祸，一起降临人间。面对昏君乱世，他忧国忧时，苦恼悲哀，虽想要勤于国事，救危扶倾，而又处境孤危，不知所措。因此只有忧伤、悲痛，怨天尤人，无可奈何。真可谓处饥馑、危亡、离乱之世，心有救乱济世之志，而行无救乱济世之力，所以只有揭示现实真象，以发泄他满腔的忧愤罢了，其感情是深沉的、真挚的。这是时代的呐喊和哀怨，因而对读者进一步认识那个时代的历史和那个时代的思想感情，也是有意义的。\n作者在抒发他那复杂而深厚的思想感情时，通篇采用了直接叙述的方式来表达，少打比喻，不绕弯子，语言质朴，感情真实，层层揭示，反覆咏叹，时而夹杂一些议论，颇有一种哀而怨、质而雅的艺术之美。\n现代译文：你这浩瀚无际的长天上苍，从不肯普照你的恩惠之光。只管降下遍地丧亡和饥荒，残害四方诸侯让百姓遭秧。老天爷挟着秋风施展暴虐，肆无忌惮不管不顾也不想。放任那些有罪的逃之夭夭，让他们的罪行全得以隐藏。相反像这些无罪的老百姓，一个挨一个相继沦落丧亡。\n\n1.浩浩：广大的样子。昊（hào）天：犹言“皇天”。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1013","poet":"先秦
