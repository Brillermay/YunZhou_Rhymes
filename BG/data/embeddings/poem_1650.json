忧国忧民\n文学赏析：这是一首写周宣王忧旱祈雨的诗。是所谓“宣王变《大雅》”的第一篇（其他五篇是《大雅·崧高》、《大雅·烝民》、《大雅·韩奕》、《大雅·江汉》和《大雅·常武》）。\n全诗八章，每章十句。一、二两章写祭神祈雨。正是需雨的时节，然而日日骄阳似火，禾稼死亡，田地龟裂，人畜缺水。这当儿，人们是多么盼望老天降落一场甘霖啊！可是仰望苍穹。毫无雨征（古人常夜间观天象以察云雨）。“倬彼云汉，昭回于天”，星河灿烂，晴空万里，夕夕如此。内心焦灼的诗人于是发出了“何辜今之人！天降丧乱，饥馑荐臻”的慨叹。无神不祭。无牲不用，礼神的玉器也用尽了，然而神灵们却不闻不问，毫无佑助之意。这苍天啊，好像真的是把降雨的事儿抛在脑后，彻底忘掉了；或许人们得罪了他，他在有意地惩罚人们。三、四两章写大旱的不可解除，主要表达了畏旱之情。“旱既大甚，则不可推”，“旱既大甚，则不可沮”，凶暴狂猛的旱灾如洪水猛兽，无法推开，无法阻拦，使“周余黎民，靡有孑遗”，造成了无法收拾的严重局面。再继续下去，将国祚难永。然而“群公先正，则不我助。父母先祖，胡宁忍予！”意谓：群公先正，我常雩祭以祈谷实，现在却不助我以兴云雨；至于父母先祖，尤一体之所亲，一气之所感，为什么也忍心看我遭此祸而不救呢？五章写旱魃继续肆虐。山原秃而河湖干，这里已经变成了一块让人无法生存下去的土地。“昊天上帝，宁俾我逐”，老天似乎是要迫使人们离开此地，他是不想让人安居了。六章述失望痛苦之余的反思。也不是祭神不及，也不是对众神不恭敬，细细思量，确实没有什么罪愆，那又为何降灾加害呢？七章叙君臣上下因忧旱而困窘憔悴。末章周王著力鞭策，希望臣子们“无弃尔成”，继续祈祷上苍。最后仰天长号，以亟求天赐安宁作结。\n统观全诗，作者对这次持久难弭的灾祸从旱象、旱情、造成的惨重损失及所引起的心理恐慌等方面作了充分的描写。这场大旱就是死亡之神的降临，可以摧毁一切，消灭人类。在那个生产力水平还很低的时代，它会造成怎样的人间灾难，是不难想像的。这首诗在写宣王忧旱的同时，也写了他的事天之敬及事神之诚。在人们抵御自然灾害的能力还极其有限的西周末期，面对无法战胜的灾害，对虚无飘渺的上帝和神灵产生敬畏乞求心理，也是不难理解的。今人自然不能以现代科学主义的观念和标准来苛责古人。\n这首诗兼叙事抒情于一体，在艺术上值得称道的有两点：一是摹景生动；二是夸饰手法的运用。“倬彼云汉，昭回于天”，夜晴则天河明，此方旱之象。“昭回于天”又暗示出仰望之久。久旱而望甘霖者，己所渴望见者无，己所不愿见者现，其心情的痛苦无奈可想而知。毫无雨征，还得继续受此大旱之苦，于是又顺理成章地推出“王曰於乎，何辜今之人！天降丧乱，饥馑荐臻”四句。所以开篇这摹景之句不仅写出了方旱之象，同时也表达了诗人的心情，并生发出下文，是独具匠心、富有艺术魅力的诗句，因而孙鑛称赞这首诗的起首“最有风味”（陈子展《诗经直解》引）。“旱既大甚，涤涤山川。旱魃为虐，如惔如焚。”这场大旱使周地变成了不毛之地，无水之区。山空川涸，禾焦草枯，畜毙人死，大地就像用火烧燎过一样，没一点生气，没一点活力。“涤涤山川”、“如惔如焚”可谓写尽旱魔肆虐之情状，同时也传达出诗人面对这种毁灭性灾害的痛苦、焦灼之情。王夫之《姜斋诗话》云：“情、景名为二．而实不可离，神于诗者，妙合无垠。巧者则情中景，景中情。”这几句诗虽然称不上“妙合无垠”，但做到景中含情、景中寓情却是很明显的。\n诗中“周余黎民，靡有孑遗”二句早在战国时代就被孟子认为是夸饰之辞的典范，备受后世批评家的关注。这两句是用夸张的艺术手法，以突出遭旱损失的惨重。南朝梁刘勰《文心雕龙》指出夸张的修辞虽然言过其实，但因为能通过形象的夸张来传难写之意、达难显之情，所以在文学作品中有它存在的必然性和合理性。确实，“靡有孑遗”四字，所述虽非事实，但...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1650","poet":"先秦
