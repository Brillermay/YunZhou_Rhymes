佚名\n正文：维鹊有巢，维鸠居之。\n之子于归，百两御之。\n维鹊有巢，维鸠方之。\n之子于归，百两将之。\n维鹊有巢，维鸠盈之。\n之子于归，百两成之。\n分类：诗经\n创作背景：关于此诗背景历来争议较大。《毛诗序》说：“《鹊巢》，夫人之德也。国君积行累功以致爵位，夫人起家而居有之，德如鳲鸠乃可以配焉。”以为此诗是写国君之婚礼；朱熹《诗集传》说：“南国诸侯被文王之化，其女子亦被后妃之化，故嫁于诸侯，而其家人美之。”以为此诗是写诸侯之婚礼，\n古今研究者对此诗背景的观点归纳起来大致有三种：\n一、鹊喻新郎，鸠喻新娘。这个观点又分两种意见：（一）这首诗是诗人代新郎言说，表达了诗人对男子的同情。喜鹊搭好了窝，鸠来居住。新郎准备好了房子，新娘来居住。以鸠居鹊巢比喻女居男室。此说以姚际恒为代表。姚际恒《诗经通论》言：“按此诗之意，其言鹊鸠者，以鸟之异类况人之异类也。其言巢与居者，以鸠之居鹊巢，况女之居男室也。”姚氏之说，尊者甚众。但是清代另一位善说《诗》者方玉润却有着不同的看法。方玉润《诗经原始》辨驳说：“自《序》《传》来，说《诗》者无不以鹊巢鸠居况女居男室矣，夫男女同类也，鹊鸠异物也，而何以为配乎？”意思是说：用鸠居鹊巢比喻女居男室，就像是说鸠婚配给了鹊犹如女嫁给了男。但是男女同类可以婚配，鸠鹊异类又怎么能相配昵？方玉润又说：“姚氏际恒最攻《序》《传》，乃其自解诗意，又以为‘言鹊鸠者，以鸟之异类况人之异类也，其言巢居者，况女之居男室也'则与旧说何异？且谓'以鸟之异类况人之异类’，男女纵不同体，而谓之异类可乎哉？此不通之论也。”（二）这首诗是新娘家人在唱赞歌，是一首新婚礼赞诗。如果以鹊喻新郎，以鸠（布谷）喻新娘，则此诗为新婿礼赞诗。朱熹将《鹊巢》的诗旨强解为以鸠比喻文王之化，行后妃之德盛而赞颂之。此一说出现最早，流传最久，影响也最大，而批评者亦最多。这种赞颂文王之化，后妃之德的说法，虽然历来因为牵强附会而被指责为完全是一种背离诗义的经学化理学化的臆断，但是他将这首诗解释为是一首新娘家人赞美婚礼的诗，是值得肯定的。\n二、鹊喻弃妇，鸠喻新妇，这是一首弃妇诗。如果以鹊喻弃妇，以鸠（布谷）喻新妇，则此诗的作者是代弃妇立言或作者本人就是弃妇，那么这是一首深切沉痛的弃妇诗。弃妇的丈夫遗弃了同他一起艰苦经营，创立家室的结发妻子，却用百辆盛车的热闹场面迎娶新妇，致使新妇占了旧妇之位，恰如”鸠占鹊巢“一般。弃妇心生嫉恨，因作此诗，以责备丈夫另娶新妇，新妇占据其家：我辛辛苦苦终于经营了一个家，现 在丈夫却将我抛弃，用盛大的车队去接新人了，而有个新妇要霸占我的家了。表达了一个为家操劳，却遭丈夫遗弃的妇女内心无比哀怨的心情。《诗经》中这类妇女很多，如《邶风·谷风》。《召南·鹊巢》中这位妇女的遭遇已经成为了一种社会现象，这首诗就是古代毫无话语权的妇女对喜新厌旧的丈夫的指责和对自己悲惨命运的无奈叙述。这实际上也是对男权社会里痴心女子负心汉婚姻现象的一种沉痛控诉，获得了强烈的社会意义。高亨在其《诗经今注》对此表示了相同的看法：”诗以鸠侵占鹊巢比喻新夫人夺去原配夫人的宫室。“同时高亨说：”（这是）召南的一个国君废了原配夫人，另娶一个新夫人，作者写这首诗叙其事，有讽刺的意味。“将这首诗的当事人具体地指为：召南的一个国君和他的两个夫人。\n三、鹊与鸠并无明确所指，只是自然界的两种鸟，且此诗的叙述者是与婚礼无关的他者。这首诗也可能只是一个与婚礼毫无关系的路人所作，诗人无意中看到一场婚礼，于是有所联想有所感触，便作了此诗。\n文学赏析：这是一首描写婚礼的诗。《毛诗序》以此诗为国君之婚礼。朱熹《诗集传》以此诗为诸侯之婚礼。从诗中描写的送迎车辆之盛可以知道，应为贵族的婚礼，而不是一般民间的婚礼。\n关于此诗诗旨历来争议较大，归纳起来大致有三种观点：\n一、鹊喻新郎，鸠喻新娘。这个观点又分两种意见：（一）这首诗是诗人代新郎言说，表达了诗人对男子的同情。喜鹊搭好了窝，鸠来居住。新郎准备好了房子，新娘来居住。以鸠居鹊巢比喻女居男室。此说以姚际恒为代表。姚际恒《诗经通论》言：“按此诗之意，其言鹊鸠者，以鸟之异类况人之异类也。其言巢与居者，以鸠之居鹊巢，况女之居男室也。”姚氏之说，尊者甚众。但是清代另一位善说《诗》者方玉润却有着不同的看法。方玉润《诗经原始》辨驳说：“自《序》《传》来，说《诗》者无不以鹊巢鸠居况女居男室矣，夫男女同类也，鹊鸠异物也，而何以为配乎？”意思是说：用鸠居鹊巢比喻女居男室，就像是说鸠婚配给了鹊犹如女嫁给了男。但是男女同类可以婚配，鸠鹊异类又怎么能相配昵？方玉润又说：“姚氏际恒最攻《序》《传》，乃其自解诗意，又以为‘言鹊鸠者，以鸟之异类况人之异类也，其言巢居者，况女之居男室也'则与旧说何异？且谓'以鸟之异类况人之异类’，男女纵不同体，而谓之异类可乎哉？此不通之论也。”（二）这首诗是新娘家人在唱赞歌，是一首新婚礼赞诗。如果以鹊喻新郎，以鸠（布谷）喻新娘，则此诗...","metadata":{"poem_id":"224","poet":"先秦
