乐歌\n创作背景：《周颂·我将》是中国古代舞蹈乐曲《大武》一成的歌诗。《大武》原作于武王伐纣成功告庙之时，当时只有三成。《逸周书·世俘》中也有记载，武王班师回镐京之四月辛亥，“荐俘、殷王鼎，武王乃翼，矢珪矢宪，告天宗上帝。”第四天，“甲寅，谒（告）我（伐）殷于牧野，王佩赤白旂，籥人奏《武》，王入进《万》，献《明明》三终。”故王国维《说勺舞象舞》一文推测，《大武》之六成是原先的三成和《三象》合并的，这六成可以分开来表演，还可以独立表演，于是名称也就随之而不同。据学者考证，《周颂·我将》为《大武》一成的歌诗。\n《大武》一成的舞蹈表现周武王观兵于盟津的历史事件。据《史记·周本纪》记载，周武王出发前曾往毕地文王墓上举行过祭祀。他这次出兵伐纣，是以文王为号召，自称“太子发”，军中载着文王的牌位，用以召集诸侯会师。所以这首诗原来盖为出兵前祭祀文王的祷词，后来伐纣成功，又将此诗确定为《大武》一成的歌诗。《毛诗序》曰：“《我将》，祀文王于明堂也。”盖《大武》之六篇诗，周代常单独使用，故于明堂祀文王亦可用该诗。\n文学赏析：《大武》的乐曲早已失传，虽有零星的资料，但终难具体描述。然其舞蹈形式则留下了一些粗略的记录，可以作大概的描绘。第一场，在经过一番擂鼓之后，为首的舞者扮演武王，头戴冕冠出场，手持干戚，山立不动。其余六十多位舞者扮武士陆续上场，长时间咏叹后退场。这一场舞蹈动作是表示武王率兵北渡盟津，等待诸侯会师，八百诸侯会合之后，急于作战，而周武王以为伐纣的时机尚不成熟，经过商讨终于罢兵的事实。第二场主演者扮姜太公，率众舞者手持干戈，奋臂击刺，猛烈顿足。他们一击一刺，做四次重复，表示武王命太公率敢死队闯犯敌阵进行挑战，武王率大军进攻，迅速获胜，威振中原。第三场众舞者由面向北转而向南，表示周师凯旋返回镐京。第四场开始时，众舞者混乱争斗，扮周、召二公的舞者出而制止，于是众舞者皆左膝跪地，表示成王即位之后，东方和南方发生叛乱，周、召二公率兵平乱的事实。第五场，众舞者分成左右两大部分，周公在左、召公在右，振动铃铎，鼓励众舞者前进，表示成王命周公镇守东南，命召公镇守西北。第六场，众舞者恢复第一场的位置，作阅兵庆典和尊崇天子成王的动作，表示周公平乱以后，庆祝天下太平，各地诸侯尊崇周天子。\n按传统说法，《诗经》是配乐舞的歌词，即诗乐舞三位一体。王国维曾怀疑这一说法，但他撰《周大武乐章考》研究《大武》的歌辞时还是按这一原则进行的，即认为《大武》六成有诗六篇。据《毛诗序》“《武》，奏《大武》也”、“《酌》，告成《大武》也”的说明，与《大武》有关的诗为《武》、《酌》，又据《左传·宣公十二年》“楚子曰：‘……武王克商，作《颂》曰：……又作《武》，其卒章曰：‘耆定尔功。’其三曰：‘铺时绎思，我徂惟求定。’其六曰：‘绥万邦，屡丰年。’”数语，提及《大武》中诗有《武》、《赉》、《桓》。这样，六篇就确定了四篇。王国维又根据《周颂》末四篇的排列顺序，认为《般》诗为其中一篇。又据《礼记·祭统》“舞莫重于《武宿夜》”一语，推断还有一篇诗，其中有“宿夜”一词，“宿夜”即“夙夜”，他认为《昊天有成命》即《武宿夜》，当为《大武》之第一篇歌诗，以下依次为《武》、《酌》、《桓》、《赉》、《般》。后经冯沅君、陆侃如，尤其是高亨的详细考辨，断定《大武》第一篇当为《我将》（详见高亨《周代大武乐考释》一文），并重新排列了后四成歌诗的次序。于是，《大武》六成的六篇诗的排列次序确定为：《我将》、《武》、《赉》、《般》、《酌》、《桓》。\n《周颂·我将》诗始言奉献牺牲于天帝，祈求天帝保佑。据《乐记》，《大武》一成象征武王出征，周人出征，必先祭祀天帝，求得天帝的保佑，此诗的首三句说的就是这事。次言继承文王之遗志，以求“日靖四方”，也就是统一并安定天下。文王时代，伐犬戎，伐密须，伐耆，伐邘，伐崇，文王殁后，武王欲完成文王未竟事业，伐纣克商，追思文王创业之功，深觉当遵循文王行之有效的种种法典。末言夙夜“畏天之威”，是说自己日夜不忘天帝和文王之命，希望得到他们的帮助，早日安定天下。对武王而言，天命和文王之典是一致的，文王的遗志也就是“天威”（天命之威）。这就是此诗把祭祀文王和祷告上天合而为一的缘故。全诗自始至终，都用第一人称的口气，即周武王出兵之前向父亲的神灵和上帝陈述出兵的目的，并祈求保佑。其语言质朴，充满敬畏之情。\n现代译文：奉上祭品献神灵，祭品有牛还有羊，祈求上天佑周邦。效法文王的典章，日日谋求安四方。伟大文王英名扬，配祀上帝祭品享。我们早晚勤努力，遵循天道畏天威，才能保佑我周邦。\n⑴我：周武王自称。将：捧。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1805","poet":"先秦
