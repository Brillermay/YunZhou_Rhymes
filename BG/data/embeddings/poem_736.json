李贺\n正文：南风吹山作平地，帝遣天吴移海水。\n王母桃花千遍红，彭祖巫咸几回死？\n青毛骢马参差钱，娇春杨柳含缃烟。\n筝人劝我金屈卮，神血未凝身问谁？\n不须浪饮丁都护，世上英雄本无主。\n买丝绣作平原君，有酒唯浇赵州土。\n漏催水咽玉蟾蜍，卫娘发薄不胜梳。\n羞见秋眉换新绿，二十男儿那刺促？\n分类：春天 写景 抒怀\n文学赏析：首四句写高山大海也会变化，人不论多么长寿，也会死。在亘古以来的时空中，一切都不是永恒不变的。五至八句言借酒销愁。九至十二句写生不逢时，怀才不遇之愤懑。诗人认为当世没有平原君那样的贤主，只好买丝绣成平原君的像，洒酒祭奠他。最后四句言人生易老，既然不遇明主，索性及时行乐吧。一个普通的意思，在李贺的笔下，竟有这么多奇思妙想。\n诗题“浩歌”语本《楚辞·九歌·少司命》，即长歌、大声唱歌、纵情放歌之类。一般说来，写作这样的诗宜从叙事写景入手。但诗人不屑于蹈袭故常，偏从虚处落笔，一开始就把想象的世界展现在读者面前：“南风吹山作平地，帝遣天吴移海水。”幻象纷呈，雄奇诡谲，却又把沧海桑田的“意”婉曲而又鲜明地表达出来了。宋人刘辰翁评这首诗说：“从‘南风’一句便不可及，佚荡宛转，真侠少年之度。”（引自姚佺《昌谷集注解定本》）诗人用豪放的笔触，雄奇的景象，抒发自己凄伤的情怀，真是既“佚荡”，又“宛转”，字里行间充溢着一种惊世骇俗的英气，所谓“侠少年之度”，指的就是这种非凡的气度。\n三、四两句，一写仙界，一写尘世。传说王母种的桃树，“三千年一开花，三千年一生实”。彭祖和巫咸则是世间寿命最长的人。当王母的桃树开花千遍的时候，彭祖和巫咸也不知死了多少次了。两相比照，见出生命的短促。长寿的彭祖和巫咸尚且不能久留人世，何况寻常之辈。这里有两个对比：一是把仙人与凡人相比，一是把凡人中的长寿者与普通人相比。前者见于字面，后者意在言外。这样层层比照、烘托，“人生几何”的命意更加显豁。\n五至八句写春游时的情景，用的是反衬手法。先着力烘托春游的盛况。“青毛”句写马。马的毛色青白相同，构成钱形花纹的名叫“连钱骢”，是为名贵之马。骑在这样的马上，饱览四周的景色，真是惬意极了。初春的杨柳笼含淡淡的烟霭。眼前的一切是那么柔美，那么逗人遐想。后来大家下马休憩，纵酒放歌，欢快之至。而当歌女手捧金杯前来殷勤劝酒的时候，诗人却沉浸在冥思苦想之中了。他想到春光易老，自己的青春年华也将逝如流水。“神血未凝身问谁”描述的正是这样一种意绪。\n接着诗歌又由抑转扬，借古讽今，指摘时弊，抒发愤世嫉俗的情怀。“丁都护”或者像王琦所说，实有其人，并且是这次郊游宴乐的参与者（见《李长吉歌诗汇解》）；或者当时有“丁都护嗜酒”的传说，诗人借以表达劝戒之意。“不须浪饮丁都护”，既是劝人，也是戒己，意思是不要因为自己怀才不遇就浪饮求醉，而应当面向现实，认识到世道沦落，英雄不受重用乃势所必然，不足为怪。诗人愈是这样自宽自慰，愤激之情就愈显得浓烈深沉。“世上”句中“无主”的“主”，影射人主，亦即当时的皇帝，以发泄对朝政的不满。“买丝”云云，与其说是敬慕和怀念平原君，毋宁说是抨击昏庸无道、埋没人才的当权者。表面写“爱”，实际写“恨”，恨自己没有机会施展才能和抱负，以致虚掷了黄金般的青春年华。\n结束四句的内容与前面各个部分都有联系，具有一定的概括性。“玉蟾蜍”是古代的一种漏壶。铜壶滴漏，声音幽细，用“咽”字来表现它，十分准确。另外，诗人感时伤遇，悲抑万端，这种内在的思想感情也借助“咽”字曲曲传出，更是传神。“此处通过具体的形象，揭示了“红颜易老”的无情规律。末二句急转直下，表示要及时行乐。“羞见秋眉换新绿”有两层意思：一是不要辜负眼前这位侑酒歌女的深情厚意；二是不愿让自己的青春年华白白流逝。既然世上没有像平原君那样识才爱士的贤哲，就不必作建功立业的非非之想。面对歌女、美酒、宝马、娇春，就纵情开怀畅饮吧。一个年方二十的男儿，正值风华正茂之时，不能这般局促偃蹇。这种及时行乐的思想，是从愤世嫉俗的感情派生出来的，是对黑暗现实发出的悲愤控诉。\n这首畅叙胸臆的诗篇，造语奇，造境也奇，使人感到耳目一新。诗人骑马踏青，面对大好的春光，本应产生舒适欢畅的感受。但偏偏就在此时，一种与外界景物格格不入的忧伤情绪像云雾般在心头冉冉升起。这种把欢乐和哀怨、明丽和幽冷等等矛盾着的因素糅合起来的现象，在李贺的诗歌里是屡见不鲜的，它使诗歌更具有神奇的魅力。此诗在结构上完全摆脱了由物起兴、以事牵情的程式。它先写“兴”，写由景物引起的神奇幻象。接着写春游，色彩秾艳，气韵沉酣，与前面的幻觉境界迥然不同，但又是产生那种幻觉的物质基础。诗人故意颠倒它们的先后次序，造成悲抑的气氛和起落的形势。\n后面从“神血”句起都是抒发身世之悲的笔墨。它们与开头相适应，有力地表达了悲愤的情怀。全诗活而不乱，粘而不滞，行文的回环曲折与感情的起落变化相适应，迷离浑化，达到了艺术上完美的统一。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴浩歌：大声唱歌。《楚辞...","metadata":{"poem_id":"736","poet":"唐代
