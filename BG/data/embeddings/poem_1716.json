佚名\n正文：泛彼柏舟，亦泛其流。\n耿耿不寐，如有隐忧。\n微我无酒，以敖以游。\n我心匪鉴，不可以茹。\n亦有兄弟，不可以据。\n薄言往愬，逢彼之怒。\n我心匪石，不可转也。\n我心匪席，不可卷也。\n威仪棣棣，不可选也。\n忧心悄悄，愠于群小。\n觏闵既多，受侮不少。\n静言思之，寤辟有摽。\n日居月诸，胡迭而微？心之忧矣，如匪浣衣。\n静言思之，不能奋飞。\n分类：诗经 爱国\n创作背景：此诗的作者和背景，历来争论颇多，迄今尚无定论。简略言之，汉代时不仅今古文有争议，而且今文三家也有不同意见。《鲁诗》主张此诗为“卫宣夫人”之作，说：“贞女不二心以数变，故有匪石之诗。”（刘向《列女传·贞顺》），《韩诗》亦同《鲁诗》说（见宋王应麟《诗考》）。《毛诗序》说：“《柏舟》，言仁而不遇也，卫顷公之时，仁人不遇，小人在侧。”这是以此诗为男子不遇于君而作，为古今文家言。今文三家，《齐诗》之说，与《诗序》同。\n自东汉郑玄笺《毛诗》以后，学者多信从《毛诗》说，及至南宋，朱熹大反《诗序》，作《诗序辩说》，又作《诗集传》，力主《柏舟》为妇人之诗，形成汉、宋学之争论。元、明以降，朱熹《诗集传》列为科举功名，影响颇大，学者又多信朱说，但持怀疑态度的亦复不少，明何楷、清陈启源、姚际恒、方玉润等皆有驳议，争论不休，至今尚未形成一致的意见。今人之《诗经》选注本、译注本各有所本，或主男著，或主女作。高亨《诗经今注》、陈子展《诗经直解》均以为男子作，而袁梅《诗经译注》、程俊英《诗经译注》又皆以为女子作。\n这些争议概括起来主要是两派：一派认为作者是男性仁臣，另一派认为作者是女子。现代学者多认为是女子所作。\n文学赏析：此诗到底为何人何事而作，历来争论颇多，迄今尚无定论。简略言之，汉代时不仅今古文有争议，而且今文三家也有不同意见。《鲁诗》主张此诗为“卫宣夫人”之作，后为刘向《列女传》之所本，《韩诗》亦同《鲁诗》说（见宋王应麟《诗考》）。《诗序》说：“《柏舟》言仁而不遇也卫顷公之时，仁人不遇，小人在侧。”这是以此诗为男子不遇于君而作，为古今文家言。今文三家，《齐诗》之说，与《诗序》同。\n自东汉郑玄笺《毛诗》以后，学者多信从《毛诗》说，及至南宋，朱熹大反《诗序》，作《诗序辩说》，又作《诗集传》，力主《柏舟》为妇人之诗，形成汉、宋学之争论。元、明以降，朱熹《诗集传》列为科举功名，影响颇大，学者又多信朱说，但持怀疑态度的亦复不少，明何楷、清陈启源、姚际恒、方玉润等皆有驳议，争论不休。\n至今尚未形成一致的意见，今人之《诗经》选注本、译注本各有所本，或主男著，或主女作。高亨《诗经今注》、陈子展《诗经直解》均以为男子作，而袁梅《诗经译注》、程俊英《诗经译注》又皆以为女子作。\n细究诗义，当以卫臣不遇于君之作为是，陈子展先生说得很准确：“今按《柏舟》，盖卫同姓之臣，仁人不遇之诗。诗义自明，《序》不为误。”此诗人的身份为男子 --- 而且是大臣，绝非平常男子（下文尚有论述），这从诗中“无酒”、“遨游”、“威仪”、“群小”、“奋飞”等词语即可看出。况且，主此诗为女子之作者的理由实不充分。刘向、朱熹之说均自相矛盾：刘向《列女传》虽以《柏舟》属之卫夫人，但是他在上封事，论群小倾陷正人时，两引此诗仍用《毛诗》义（《汉书·楚元王传·刘向传》，又在《说苑·立节》中引用此诗时，也用《毛诗》义，说“此士君子之所以越众也”‘朱熹先从刘向之“卫宣夫人”说，后又疑其为“庄姜”（《诗集传》），切在《孟子·尽心下》：“‘忧心悄悄，愠于群小’孔子也。”注曰：“《诗·邶风·柏舟》....本言卫之仁人见怒于群小。孟子以为孔之事可以当之。”是不能自圆其说的，也都是自语相违。\n另外，需要说明的是，此诗既属《邶风》，为何却咏卫国之事？原来“邶”、“鄘”、“卫”连地，原为殷周之旧都，武王灭殷后，占领殷都朝歌一带地方，三分其地。邶在朝歌之北，鄘。卫都朝歌，为成王封康叔之地，“邶、鄘始封，及后何时并入于卫，诸家均未详。....惟邶、鄘既入卫，诗多卫风，而犹系其故国之名。”（方玉润《诗经原始》）所以邶诗咏卫事也是可以理解的。另外，方玉润认为此诗可能即为邶诗，“安知非即邶诗乎?邶既为卫所并，其未亡也，国事必孱。......当此之时，必有贤人君子，......故作为是诗，以其一腔忠愤，不忍弃君，不能远祸之心。”也有一定的参考价值。\n这首诗凡五章。第一章写作者夜不能寐，原因是怀有深忧，无法排遣。首二句，“泛彼柏舟，亦泛其流”，以自喻，虽以喻国，以舟自喻，喻忧心之沉重而飘忽，以“舟喻国，泛泛然于水中流，其势靡所底止，为此而有隐忧，乃见仁人用心所在”（《诗经原始》）。诗一开始就写出了抒情主人公沉郁的心情。接着点明夜不成眠的原因是由于痛苦忧伤一齐涌积心头，这里既有国家式微之痛，又有个人不遇于君、无法施展抱负之苦。“隐忧”是诗眼，贯穿全篇。末二句写出了作者的忧国之心和伤己之情，即使美酒、遨游也不能排除自己的痛苦忧伤。何楷《诗经世本古义》...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1716","poet":"先秦
