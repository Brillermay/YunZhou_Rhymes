赞颂 写人\n创作背景：《诗序》说此诗是召康公戒周成王之作。其上承《大雅·生民》，下接《大雅·緜》。《大雅·生民》写周人始祖在邰（故址在今陕西武功县境内）从事农业生产；此篇写公刘由北豳迁豳开疆创业；而《大雅·緜》诗则写古公亶父自豳迁居岐下（在今陕西岐县），以及文王继承遗烈，使周之基业得到进一步发展。\n公刘，陆德明《经典释文》引《尚书大传》云：“公，爵；刘，名也。”后世多合而称之曰公刘。夏太康之时，后稷的儿子不窋失其职守，自窜于戎狄。不窋生了鞠陶，鞠陶生了公刘。公刘迁豳，恢复了后稷所从事的农业，人民逐渐富裕。“乃相土地之宜，而立国于豳之谷焉”（见《豳风》朱熹《诗集传》）。\n《诗集传》谓：“旧说召康公以成王将莅政，当戒以民事，故咏公刘之事以告之曰：‘厚者，公刘之于民也！”’若是成王时召康公所作，则约在公元前十一世纪前后，可见公刘的故事在周人中已流传好几代，至此时方整理成文。\n文学赏析：此诗共六章，每章六句，均以“笃公刘”发端，从这赞叹的语气来看，必是周之后人所作，着重记载了公刘迁豳以后开创基业的史实。\n诗之首章写公刘出发前的准备。他在邰地划分疆界，领导人民勤劳耕作，将丰收的粮食装进仓库，制成干粮，又一袋一袋包装起来。接着又挽弓带箭，拿起干戈斧钺各种武器，然后浩浩荡荡向豳地进发。以下各章写到达豳地以后的各种举措，他先是到原野上进行勘察，有时登上山顶，有时走在平原，有时察看泉水，有时测量土地。然后开始规划哪里种植，哪里建房，哪里养殖，哪里采石……一切安顿好了，便设宴庆贺，推举首领。首领既定，又组织军队，进行防卫。诗篇将公刘开拓疆土、建立邦国的过程，描绘得清清楚楚，仿佛将读者带进远古时代，观看了一幅先民勤劳朴实的生活图景。\n整篇之中，突出地塑造了公刘这位人物形象。他深谋远虑，具有开拓进取的精神。他在邰地从事农业本可以安居乐业，但他“匪居匪康”，不敢安居，仍然相土地之宜，率领人民开辟环境更好的豳地。作为部落之长，他很有组织才能，精通领导艺术。出发之前，他进行了精心的准备，必待兵精粮足而后启行。既到之后，不辞劳苦，勘察地形，规划建设，事无巨细，莫不躬亲。诗云：“陟则在巘，复降在原。何以舟之？维玉及瑶，鞞琫容刀。”他身上佩带着美玉宝石和闪闪发光的刀鞘，登山涉水，亲临第一线，这样具有光辉形象的领导者，自然得到群众的拥护，也自然会得到后世学者的赞扬。\n诗中不仅写了作为部落之长的公刘，而且也写了民众，写了公刘与民众之间齐心协力、患难与共的关系。诗云：“思辑用光。”又云：“既庶既繁，既顺乃宣，而无永叹。”是说他们思想上团结一致，行动上紧紧相随，人人心情舒畅，没有一个在困难面前唉声叹气。“于时处处，于时庐旅，于时言言，于时语语”，诗人用了一组排比句，讴歌了人们在定居以后七嘴八舌、谈笑风生的生动场面。\n看来在公刘的时代，似乎既有一定的组织纪律，也有一定的民主自由。诗云：“跄跄济济，俾筵俾几。既登乃依，乃造其曹。执豕于牢，酌之用匏。食之饮之，君之宗之。”在欢庆的宴会上，人们依次入座，共享丰盛的酒肴。在酒足饭饱之际，人们共同推举首领，这中间似可窥见先民政治生活的一个缩影。\n此诗的特点是在行动中展示当时的社会风貌，在具体场景中刻画人物形象。无论是“弓矢斯张，干戈戚扬”的行进行列，无论是“既溥既长，既景乃冈，相其阴阳”的勘察情景，都将人与景结合起来描写，因而景中有人，栩栩如生。微感不足的是写勘察的地方较多，二、三、五、六四节虽各有侧重，然重复之处亦在所难免。这大概是由于当时部落的生活还比较单纯，其他无甚可写所致。然而在那个时代能有这样的史诗，确也难能可贵。\n现代译文：忠厚我祖好公刘，不图安康和享受。划分疆界治田畴，仓里粮食堆得厚，包起干粮备远游。大袋小袋都装满，大家团结光荣久。佩起弓箭执戈矛，盾牌刀斧都拿好，向着前方开步走。\n\n1.笃：诚实忠厚。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1561","poet":"先秦
