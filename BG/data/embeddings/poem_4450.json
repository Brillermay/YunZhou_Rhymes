叙事 闺怨 民谣\n文学赏析：《卫风·氓》是一首上古民间歌谣，以一个女子之口，率真地述说了其情变经历和深切体验，是一帧情爱画卷的鲜活写照，也为后人留下了当时风俗民情的宝贵资料。\n这是一首短短的夹杂抒情的叙事诗，将一个情爱故事表现得真切自然。诗中女子情深意笃，爱得坦荡，爱得热烈。即便婚后之怨，也是用心专深的折射。真真好一个善解人意、勤劳聪慧、果敢率真、通情明义的鲜明形象。在婚前，她怀着对氓炽热的深情，勇敢地冲破了礼法的束缚，毅然和氓同居，这在当时来说，是一件难能可贵的事。按理说，婚后的生活应该是和睦美好的。但事与愿违，她却被氓当牛马般使用，甚至被打被弃。原因就是当时妇女在社会上和家庭中都没有地位，而只是的丈夫的附庸。这种政治、经济的不平等决定了男女在婚姻关系上的不平等，使氓得以随心所欲地玩弄、虐待妇女而不受制裁，有抛弃妻子解除婚约的权利。“始乱终弃”四字，正可概括氓对女子的罪恶行为。因此她虽曾勇敢地冲破过封建的桎梏，但她的命运，终于同那些在父母之命、媒妁之言压束下逆来顺受的妇女命运，很不幸地异途同归了。“士之耽兮，犹可说也；女之耽也，不可说也！”诗人满腔愤懑地控诉了这社会的不平，使这诗的思想意义更加深化。诗中女主人公的惨痛经历，可说是阶级社会中千千万万受压迫受损害的妇女命运的缩影，故能博得后世读者的共鸣。\n诗中虽以抒情为主，所叙的故事也还不够完整细致，但它已将女主人公的遭遇、命运，比较真实地反映出来，抒情叙事融为一体，时而夹以慨叹式的议论。就这些方面说，这首诗已初步具备中国式的叙事诗的某些特征。这些特征或多或少地影响到其后二千余年的叙事诗，在《孔雀东南飞》《长恨歌》，直到近代姚燮的《双鸩篇》中似乎都可以看到它的影子。\n《氓》诗的结构，是和它的故事情节与作者叙述时激昂波动的情绪相适应的。全诗六章，每章十句，但并不像《诗经》其他各篇采用复沓的形式，而是依照人物命运发展的顺序，自然地加以抒写。它以赋为主，兼用比兴。赋以叙事，兴以抒情，比在于加强叙事和抒情的色彩。\n开头一、二章，《诗集传》云：“赋也。”具体描写男子向女主人公求婚以至结婚的过程。那是在一次集市上，一个男子以买丝为名，向女主人公吐露爱情，一会儿嬉皮笑脸，一会儿又发脾气，可谓软硬兼施。可是这位单纯的女子看不透他的本质，说是必须有人来说媒，最后将婚期订在秋天。从此以后，女子朝思暮想，“乘彼垝垣，以望复关”，望不到男子所住的复关，便泪流不止；既见复关，就像见到所恋之人，不禁眉开眼笑。她还打卦占卜，预测婚事的吉凶。及至男方派车前来迎娶，她就带着全部的财物，嫁了过去。这两章叙事真切，历历可见，而诗人作为一个纯情少女的自我形象，也刻画得栩栩如生。方玉润评这一段云：“不见则忧，既见则喜，夫情之所不容已者，女殆痴于情者耳。”（《诗经原始》）一个“痴”字。点出了此女钟情之深。\n朱熹《诗集传》谓第三章“比而兴也”，第四章“兴也”，也就是说这两章以抒情为主，诗中皆以桑树起兴，从诗人的年轻貌美写到体衰色减，同时揭示了男子对她从热爱到厌弃的经过。“桑之未落，其叶沃若”，以桑叶之润泽有光，比喻女子的容颜亮丽。“桑之落矣，其黄而陨”，以桑叶的枯黄飘落，比喻女子的憔悴和被弃。“于嗟鸠兮，无食桑葚；于嗟女兮，无与士耽”，则以“戒鸠无食桑葚以兴下句戒女无与士耽也”（《诗集传》）。桑葚是甜的，鸠多食则易致醉；爱情是美好的，人多迷恋则易上当受骗。男人沉溺于爱情犹可解脱。女子一旦堕入爱河，则无法挣离。这是多么沉痛的语言！从桑叶青青到桑叶黄落，不仅显示了女子年龄的由盛到衰，而且暗示了时光的推移。“自我徂尔，三岁食贫”，一般以为女子嫁过去三年，但另有一种解释：“三岁，多年。按‘三’是虚数，言其多，不是实指三年。”（程俊英《诗经译注》）实际上是说女子嫁过去好几年，夫妻关系渐渐不和，终至破裂。女子不得已又坐着车子，渡过淇水，回到娘家。她反覆考虑，自己并无一点差错，而是那个男子“二三其德”。在这里女子以反省的口气回顾了婚后的生活，找寻被遗弃的原因，结果得到了一条教训：在以男子为中心的社会里，只有痴心女子负心...","metadata":{"poem_id":"4450","poet":"先秦
