李世民\n正文：塞外悲风切，交河冰已结。\n瀚海百重波，阴山千里雪。\n迥戍危烽火，层峦引高节。\n悠悠卷旆旌，饮马出长城。\n寒沙连骑迹，朔吹断边声。\n胡尘清玉塞，羌笛韵金钲。\n绝漠干戈戢，车徒振原隰。\n都尉反龙堆，将军旋马邑。\n扬麾氛雾静，纪石功名立。\n荒裔一戎衣，灵台凯歌入。\n分类：冬天 边塞 爱国 战争 生活\n创作背景：李世民的《饮马长城窟行》创作于贞观二十年(646年)九月驻跸灵州，太宗平定宋金刚之乱时，于“（武德）二年十一月，太宗率众趣龙门关，履冰而渡之”，诗中所描写的悲壮之景当是诗人亲眼所见，此诗亦是濡笔马上而作。\n文学赏析：这是一首汉乐府民歌，它书写了大唐平定天下，开创贞观之治后太宗皇帝的感慨。全诗没有具体描写两军作战的场面，而是形象地描述了这场战争的发生发展与胜利的过程，是一首描写当时现实事件的史诗。\n“塞外悲风切，交河冰已结。”切，凄切。交河，北方河名。句意为：塞外，寒风悲鸣，十分凄切，交河上，严冰封冻了河道。据《旧唐书·太宗本纪》所载，太宗平定宋金刚之乱时，于“（武德）二年十一月，太宗率众趣龙门关，履冰而渡之”，可见诗中所描写的悲壮之景当是诗人亲眼所见，想必此诗亦是濡笔马上而作。\n“瀚海百重波，阴山千里雪。”瀚海，沙漠。波，沙丘起伏状。句意为：广袤的沙漠上，沙丘连绵不断，阴山上千里雪覆。此联进一步写塞外之景，壮阔迷茫，渲染了一种壮烈豪迈之情。其眼光，其气度，真有指点江山，总揽寰宇之势，这一点是此后的许多诗人都难以企及的。\n“迥戍危烽火，层峦引高节。”迥戌，远方的边戍。高节，旗帜。句意为：烽火中传来了远方的紧急军情，我于是挥兵远赴边疆，一路上层叠的山峦引导着我的旗帜。此二句点明为救边而出征，军队沿着山路前行，仿佛是山引领着队伍，意即此战很得天时，必将获胜。\n“悠悠卷旆旌，饮马出长城。”句意为：风儿轻轻地吹起旗帜，我们挥师出长城而饮水放马。马是古代战争最重要的交通工具，到某处饮马，意即对某处用兵，占领某地。自秦以来，长城一直是重要的守御工事，诗人敢为前人所不敢为，兵出长城，争雄天下，其傲视寰宇的胸怀确实令后人追慕不已。这两句点明了题中驰骋宇内，以天下为牧场之意。\n“寒沙连骑迹，朔吹断边声。”朔吹，北风。句意为：寒冷的沙漠上，骑兵过处，迹印连绵；凛冽的北风阻隔了边塞的噪杂之声。这是写进军途中所遇到的艰难险阻。\n“胡尘清玉塞，羌笛韵金钲。”玉塞，玉门关。金钲，锣声。句意为：玉门关一带，胡人入侵的嚣尘已经消逝，羌人们正吹着笛子，敲着金锣，载歌载舞。大军所指，蛮夷慑服，边境一带很快呈现出一片祥和、安宁的和平气象。并非倚仗武力，更多的是以德感召，所以使羌人载歌载舞心悦诚服。《旧唐书·太宗本纪》载：“自是西北诸蕃成请上尊号为‘天可汗’。”可见在处理与边疆少数民族的关系上，太宗是做得很成功的，从这两句诗中就可以看到这一点。\n“绝漠干戈戢，车徒振原隰。”绝漠，大漠。干戈，指武器。戢，收藏。原隰，原野。句意为：大漠之上，武器收藏，车仗过处，原野为之震动。平夷战祸后，军队凯旋，所到之处，群情振奋。所谓“吊民伐罪”，正义的战争，人民从来都是支持的。\n“都尉反龙堆，将军旋马邑。”龙堆，即白龙堆，今新疆库木塔格沙漠。句意为：都尉从龙堆返回，将军们从马邑凯旋而归。这两句是互文见义，称述得胜还朝，所用地名都是边塞一带，给人以真实感，此后的边塞诗也常用这种手法，罗列多个边关地名，虽然这些地区往往与诗中的事件并无关联，而且地名之间常常不具有确定的逻辑关系。\n“扬麾氛雾静，纪石功名立。”纪石，刻石纪功。句意为：旗帜飘扬，云雾弥漫的氛围因之消歇，将士们功勋卓著，应该把他们的功绩刻在石头上，永远流传后世。这里运用了象征手法，“扬麾”指唐军旗帜鲜明地出战，“氛雾”形容外敌入侵，一片纷扰之状。这是对将士们的称述，也是勉励将士们努力作战以名垂千古，同时也是自勉。\n“荒裔一戎衣，灵台凯歌入。”荒裔，边荒。戎衣，战士。灵台，周代台名。《后汉书·桓谭传》：“其后有诏会议灵台所处。”《三国志·魏书·王朗传》注：“明堂所以祀上帝，灵台所以观天文。”这里指代朝廷。句意为：边远、荒凉之地只需一介之士戍守，朝廷中已有凯歌高奏。大唐王朝，威镇四夷，只需很少的守兵，就可以保证国家的长治久安。李唐全盛时，的确如这两句所描述的那样，边境安宁，四境宾服。\n现代译文：塞外悲凉的风刮得急切，交河上的凌冰已经冻结，浩瀚的大海掀起了千百万的波涛，阴山之下千万里全都落满了白雪。\n\n⑴切：凄切。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2228","poet":"唐代
