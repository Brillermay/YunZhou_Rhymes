杜审言\n正文：毗陵震泽九州通，士女欢娱万国同。\n伐鼓撞钟惊海上，新妆袨服照江东。\n梅花落处疑残雪，柳叶开时任好风。\n火德云官逢道泰，天长日久属年丰。\n分类：饮宴 大酺\n文学赏析：酺指的是百姓聚集在一起饮宴。古时国家有“吉庆”事，允许百姓聚饮。其中一首《大酺》作于公元689年（永昌元年），因武则天选择正月庆祝自己加尊号“圣母神皇”，“亲享明堂，大赦天下，改元，大酺日。”（《旧唐书·则天皇后纪》）杜审言的诗从正面赞颂武则天的功德。\n而这首《大酺》诗，大概作于公元690年（天授元年）武则天改唐为周之后，因此诗里有“火德云官”之称。因为以五行相推武周是火德。这首《大酺》诗写得别开生面，突出表现民间的欢娱，那热闹的场面如同庆丰收或过传统的盛大节日一样，传达了诗人与民同乐的情绪。我国古代封建统治者是禁止百姓聚饮的，汉律规定，三人以上，无故群饮，罚金四两。唐亦有类似规定。百姓平时难得有欢聚开怀畅饮的机会，所以“大酺”时民情振奋，钟鼓齐鸣，欢声雷动。从诗中表现出百姓的物资生活和精神状态，也反映了当时国力的强盛，经济的繁荣，一派太平盛世的景象。\n这首诗发端别致，起句七个字连举三个地名，毗陵、震泽、九州，而最后以一“通”字，把它们的关系明确固定下来，构成一个恢宏辽阔的意境。毗陵代指诗人当时任职的江阴县，江阴为晋陵郡所属，毗陵为晋陵古名。诗歌常用古名，以求典雅不俗。同理用震泽不用太湖。“毗陵”、“震泽”除声音响亮、声调和谐外，还给人以丰富的意象。这句诗，从内容上看就是江阴通太湖达全国，但这句诗还为全诗布置一个旷大的背景，以利于感情的铺陈。诗题为“大酺”，不便从小县写起，因此诗人从大处落笔，以毗陵、震泽通天下包举全国。次句接以“士女欢娱万国同”，指男男女女饮酒作乐，欢度这普天同庆的日子。\n颔联具体叙述“士女欢娱”的景象。诗中只选择了“伐鼓撞钟”的场面，并以“惊海上”的夸张表现了庆祝活动声势的浩大。又以“新妆袨服”光彩“照江东”来渲染庆祝场面的热烈壮观。清《石园诗话》认为这联诗与“啼鸟惊残梦，飞花搅独愁”，“云霞出海曙，梅柳渡江春”等均为审言名句。\n颈联“梅花落处疑残雪，柳叶开时任好风”，写景兼抒情。梅花飘落，柳叶新发，正是乍暖还寒的初春季节。皑皑“白雪”，阵阵冷香，青青柔条，丝丝暖馨，形成一派春回大地的景象。春，即使万象更新又给人以希望。柳遇好风，比喻民逢明君，暗寓皇恩浩荡如春风。\n尾联以赞颂和祈愿作结。“火德云官逢道泰”，是写武则天顺民意得大道，文武群臣时运亨通。“天长日久属年丰”，承上句意，为百姓祈福，但愿国家长存，年年岁岁五谷丰登。诗以民情开始，又以写民愿作结。首尾相应，自然浑成。\n杜审言这首《大酺》正如胡应麟所评说的“极高华雄整”。若就其所要表现的《大酺》主题来说，其形式是精美得当的，而且内容和形式也达到了高度的统一。这首诗的突出特点是气象博大，给读者以高华雄整的美感。这虽然与造意取词、取象设色有关，但更主要的在于诗人的心胸和气质以及艺术修养等。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2565","poet":"唐代
