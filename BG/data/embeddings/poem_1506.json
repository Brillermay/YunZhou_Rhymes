咏史 赞美 写人\n文学赏析：中国传统诗歌源远流长，但以叙事为主的史诗却一向不发达，因此《诗经》中为数不多的几篇具有史诗性质的作品，便受到今人的充分关注。《大雅·生民》就是这样的作品。\n此诗带有浓重的传说成分，而对农业生产的详细描写，也反映出当时农业已同畜牧业分离而完成了第一次社会大分工的事实。\n诗共八章，每章或十句或八句，按十字句章与八字句章前后交替的方式构成全篇，除首尾两章外，各章皆以“诞”字领起，格式严谨。从表现手法上看，它纯用赋法，不假比兴，叙述生动详明，纪实性很强。然而从它的内容看，尽管后面几章写后稷从事农业生产富有浓郁的生活气息，却仍不能脱去前面几章写后稷的身世所显出的神奇荒幻气氛，这无形中也使其艺术魅力大大增强。\n诗的第一章写姜嫄神奇的受孕。这章最关键的一句话是“履帝武敏歆”，对这句话的解释众说纷纭，历来是笺注《诗经》的学者最感兴趣的问题之一。毛传把这句话纳入古代的高禖（古代帝王为求子所祀的禖神）祭祀仪式中去解释，云：“后稷之母（姜嫄）配高辛氏帝（帝喾）焉。……古者必立郊禖焉，玄鸟至之日，以大牢祠于郊禖，天子亲往，后妃率九嫔御，乃礼天子所御，带以弓韣（dú），授以弓矢于郊禖之前。”也就是说高辛氏之帝率领其妃姜嫄向生殖之神高禖祈子，姜嫄踏着高辛氏的足印，亦步亦趋，施行了一道传统仪式，便感觉怀了孕，求子而得子。唐代孔颖达的疏也执此说。但汉代郑玄的笺与毛传之说不同，他主张姜嫄是踩了天帝的足迹而怀孕生子的。云：“姜嫄之生后稷如何乎？乃禋祀上帝于郊禖，以祓除其无子之疾，而得其福也。帝，上帝也；敏，拇也。……祀郊禖之时，时则有大神之迹，姜嫄履之，足不能满履其拇指之处，心体歆歆然，其左右所止住，如有人道感己者也。于是遂有身。”这样的解释表明君王的神圣裔传来自天帝，是一个神话。然在后世，郑玄的解释遭到了王充、洪迈、王夫之等人的否定。现代学者闻一多对这一问题写有《姜嫄履大人迹考》专文，认为这则神话反映的事实真相，“只是耕时与人野合而有身，后人讳言野合，则曰履人之迹，更欲神异其事，乃曰履帝迹耳”。他采纳了毛传关于高禖仪式的说法，并对之作了文化人类学的解释：“上云禋祀，下云履迹，是履迹乃祭祀仪式之一部分，疑即一种象征的舞蹈。所谓‘帝’，实即代表上帝之神尸。神尸舞于前，姜嫄尾随其后，践神尸之迹而舞，其事可乐，故曰‘履帝武敏歆’，犹言与尸伴舞而心甚悦喜也。‘攸介攸止’，‘介’，林义光读为‘愒（qí）’，息也，至确。盖舞毕而相携止息于幽闭之处，因而有孕也。”闻一多的见解是可取的。还有两点：一、足迹无非是种象征，因此像王夫之等人那样力图在虚幻和事实之间架桥似乎是徒劳的。二、象征的意义是通过仪式的摹仿来完成的，舞蹈之类都是摹仿仪式，而语言本身也可以完成象征的意义，如最初起源于祭仪的颂诗；正是由于语言的这种表现能力的扩张，神话才超越了现实，诗歌乃具有神奇的魅力。\n诗的第二章、第三章写后稷的诞生与屡弃不死的灵异。后稷名弃，据《史记·周本纪》的解释，正是因为他在婴幼时曾屡遭遗弃，才得此名。此篇对他三次遭弃又三次获救的经过情形叙述十分细致。第一次，后稷被扔在小巷里，结果是牛羊跑来用乳汁喂养了他。第二次，后稷被扔进了大树林，结果正巧有樵夫来砍柴，将他救出。第三次后稷被扔在了寒冰之上，结果天上飞来只大鸟，用温暖的羽翼覆盖他温暖他。初生的婴儿经历了如此大的磨难，终于哇哇哭出了声，声音洪亮有力，回荡在整条大路上，预示着他将来会创造辉煌的业绩。那么，对于后稷遭弃这一弃子之谜，历代经史学家有许多解释。贱弃说在鲁诗中就已产生，刘向《列女传》和郑玄笺都执此说。另一较早的说法是遗腹说，首先由马融提出。此后，苏洵持难产说，朱熹持易生说，王夫之持避乱说，臧琳持早产说，胡承珙持速孕说。另外又有晚生说、怪胎说、不哭说、假死说、阴谋说等等。近世学者则多从民俗学角度出发，各倡轻男说、杀长说、宜弟说、触忌说、犯禁说等。英雄幼时蒙难是世界性的传说故...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1506","poet":"先秦
