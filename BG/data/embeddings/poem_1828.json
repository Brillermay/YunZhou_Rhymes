佚名\n正文：执竞武王，无竞维烈。\n不显成康，上帝是皇。\n自彼成康，奄有四方，斤斤其明。\n钟鼓喤喤，磬莞将将，降福穰穰。\n降福简简，威仪反反。\n既醉既饱，福禄来反。\n分类：诗经 祭祀 赞颂 写人\n文学赏析：此诗前七句叙述了周武王、周成王、周康王的功业，赞颂了他们开国拓疆的丰功伟绩，祈求他们保佑后代子孙福寿安康，永远昌盛。在祖先的神主面前，祭者不由追忆起武王创业开国的艰难，眼前浮现出几代祖先英武睿智的形象：击灭商纣，开邦立国的武王，东征西讨，开拓疆土的成王、康王。既有对祖先的缅怀、崇敬、赞美，也是吹捧祖先、炫耀门庭、沾沾自喜的一种心理反映。\n接着此诗又以四件典型的乐器，采用虚实结合的手法，渲染、烘托了祭祀场所的环境氛围：钟声当当，鼓响咚咚，磬音嘹亮，管乐悠扬，一派其乐融融的升平景象。通过这四种乐器奏出的音乐，触发了人们丰富的联想：在平坦广阔的大地上，矗立着巍峨的祖庙群（天子九庙），像天上诸神的圣殿，高屋深墙，宫阙衔连；在祭祀的内堂，分列着各个祖先的神主，前面的供台上陈列着各种精心准备的祭品，或牛或羊或豕或粢盛或秬鬯，令人不禁肃然起敬。两旁直立着许多随祭的臣仆，屏神静气，主祭者周王一丝不苟地行着祭祀大礼。钟鼓齐鸣，乐声和谐，吟诵的祭辞，虽然平直简约，但是在祭祖这一特定的场所，抚今忆昔，浮想联翩，仍可体味出理性的文字后面掩藏的那一缕幽思。\n此诗在文学技巧上运用了赋的艺术手法，“铺陈其事而直言之”（朱熹语），叙说简明，直道其事，以简古的语言为祖先歌功颂德，祈求福庇。诗意虽然略显浅易，但因是与古乐相合而诵，又在“穆清”“肃雍”的庙堂使用，有着超出单纯文字所表达的功能，即特定的环境氛围、特定的心理感受会产生特殊的欣赏效果。远古诗歌，研究者多以为是诗、乐、舞三者合一的，颂诗也是如此，不单是具有文学性一个方面，因此要全面、准确地把握其内涵、风神，就不能只局限于文字上的表面理解，而应以文字为契机，从庙堂文化这个大范围的角度进行整体的品味、把握，结合对音乐、舞蹈、建筑艺术特点的联想，作全方位的审美观照，才能领会包括此诗在内的颂诗那种庄严、高贵、古穆、雍容的艺术内涵。因为颂诗的功用在于“美盛德之形容，以其成功告于神明”（《毛诗序》），这一目的决定了它的形式、内容、语言风格的特点，也决定了它的使用范围仅仅是王公贵族，也就是说颂诗的审美趣味与它的使用价值是相互统一，互为因果的。\n此诗是昭王时代的祭歌，比起早一些的颂诗，在用韵方面，有了明显的进步。其最突出的特点是，对祭祀仪式隆重尤其是乐器齐奏进行了形象生动斩描述。“喤喤”“将将”“穰穰”“简简”“反反”等叠字词的连续使用，语气舒缓深长，庄严肃穆，给人一种身临其境的感觉，体现出庙堂文化深厚的底蕴。\n颂诗的实用性、针对性较强，现代研究者对它的文学价值多有贬斥。固然颂诗是仅供统治阶级玩赏的庙堂文学，缺乏文学意味；但它那种古穆肃雍的艺术风格对后世仪式化的官方文学产生了相当深远的影响，这是不容忽视的事实。\n现代译文：勇猛强悍数武王，无人武功比他强。明君成王和康王，上天对其也赞扬。从那成康时代起，周邦统一占四方，英明善察好眼光。\n\n⑴执：借为“鸷”，猛。竞：借为“勍（qíng）”，强。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1828","poet":"先秦
