闺怨\n文学赏析：作为一个社会问题，丈夫因境遇变化或用情不专而遗弃结发之妻，在《诗经》这部汉族文学史上最早的诗歌总集中已多有反映，《卫风·氓》是一篇，《邶风·谷风》又是一篇。同样是用弃妇的口吻陈述被弃的痛苦，与《卫风·氓》相比，《邶风·谷风》中的女子在性格上不如前者决绝果断，因此在回忆往事和述说情怀时怨而不怒，并没有对负心汉进行直接的谴责，然而在艺术风格上，则更能体现被孔子称道的温柔敦厚的诗教传统。\n从全诗的叙说来看，这位女子的丈夫原来也是贫穷的农民，只是由于婚后两人的共同努力，尤其是年轻妻子的辛劳操持，才使日子慢慢好过了起来。但是这种生活状况的改善，反倒成了丈夫遗弃她的原因。这个负心汉不但不顾念患难中的糟糠之妻，相反却喜新厌旧，把她当作仇人，有意寻隙找岔，动辄拳脚相加，最后终于在迎亲再婚之日，将她赶出了家门。诗中的弃妇就是在这种情形下，如泣如诉地倾吐了心中的满腔冤屈。\n这首诗在抒情方面最可注意的有以下几点：首先是选取了最能令人心碎的时刻，使用对比的手法，凸现了丈夫的无情和自己被弃的凄凉。这个时刻就是新人进门和旧人离家，对于一个用情专一、为美好生活献出了一切的女子来说，没有比这一刻更让人哀怨欲绝的了。诗由此切入，非常巧妙地抓住了反映这一出人生悲剧的最佳契机，从而为整首诗的抒情展开提供了基础。而一方面“宴尔新昏，如兄如弟”的热闹和亲密，另一方面“不远伊迩，薄送我畿”的绝情和冷淡，形成了一种高度鲜明的对比，更突出了被弃之人的无比愁苦，那种典型的哀怨气氛被渲染得十分浓烈。\n其次是借用生动的比喻言事表情，具有浓郁的生活气息。全诗共分六章，每章都有含蓄不尽的妙喻。如第一章入手便以大风和阴雨，来表现丈夫的经常无故发怒；以采来蔓菁萝卜的根茎被弃，来暗示他丢了根本，视宝为废。这主要用于言事。第二章则转用食荼如荠、以苦为甜，来反衬人物在见了丈夫新婚时内心的苦涩程度，远在荼菜的苦味之上。这又是主要用于表情。另如第三章的“泾以渭浊，湜湜其沚”，是用泾水因渭水流入表面变浊、其底仍清，来比喻自己尽管被丈夫指责却依然不改初衷的清白；第四章以河深舟渡、水浅泳渡，喻写以往生活不论有何困难，都能想方设法予以解决；第五章用“贾用不售”比丈夫的嫌弃、“比予于毒”喻对己的憎恶；第六章又把自己往日的辛劳比作御冬的“旨蓄”，将丈夫的虐待喻为湍急咆哮的水流。这些比喻取喻浅近，无不切合被喻情事的特征，大大增强了作品的艺术性和表现力。\n最后，作品的一唱三叹、反复吟诵，也是表现弃妇烦乱心绪和一片痴情的一大特色。从首章的“黾勉同心，不宜有怒”、“德音莫违，及尔同死”，到二章的“行道迟迟，中心有违”，从三章的“毋逝我粱，毋发我笱”，到四、五章的前后对比，再到六章的“不念昔者，伊余来塈”，在反覆的述写和表白中，淋漓尽致地展示了弃妇沉溺于往事旧情而无法自拔的复杂心理。顺着这一感情脉络的延伸展开，循环往复，人们更能接近和触摸这个古代女子的善良和多情的心，更能感受到被弃带给她的精神创痛。至于作品在二、三、六章中一而再、再而三地出现“宴尔新昏”这样的句子，又在断续错杂的回忆和抒情中，突出和强调了丈夫背信弃义对她产生的强烈刺激，她无法忍受眼前出现的这一现实，更不能以平常之心来接受这一现实，所以反复咏之，以示铭心刻骨，难以忽忘。\n由此可见，这首诗在抒写弃妇哀怨方面是很有特色的。它的出现，表明古代妇女在爱情和婚姻生活中，很早就处在弱者的地位，充当着以男子为中心的社会的牺牲品，她们的命运是值得同情的。尽管作品没有直接对负情男子作明确的谴责，但最初的信誓旦旦和最终的弃如脱靴，仍为此作了有力的点示，具有深刻的警世作用。\n现代译文：山谷来风迅又猛，阴云密布大雨倾。夫妻共勉结同心，不该动怒不相容。采摘萝卜和蔓青，难道要叶不要根？往日良言休抛弃：到死与你不离分。\n\n1.邶（bèi）：中国周代诸侯国名，地在今河南省汤阴县东南。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2716","poet":"先秦
