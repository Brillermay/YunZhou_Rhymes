佚名\n正文：蒹葭苍苍，白露为霜。\n所谓伊人，在水一方。\n溯洄从之，道阻且长。\n溯游从之，宛在水中央。\n蒹葭萋萋，白露未晞。\n所谓伊人，在水之湄。\n溯洄从之，道阻且跻。\n溯游从之，宛在水中坻。\n蒹葭采采，白露未已。\n所谓伊人，在水之涘。\n溯洄从之，道阻且右。\n溯游从之，宛在水中沚。\n分类：古诗三百首 诗经 初中古诗 高中古诗 怀人 爱情\n创作背景：关于这首诗的内容，历来意见分歧。归纳起来，主要有以下三种说法：一是“刺襄公”说。《毛诗序》云：“蒹葭，刺襄公也。未能用周礼，将无以固其国焉。”今人苏东天在《诗经》辨义中阐（chǎn ）析说：“‘在水一方’的‘所谓伊人’（那个贤人），隐喻周王朝礼制。如果逆周礼而治国，那就‘道阻且长’、‘且跻’、‘且右’，意思是走不通、治不好的。如果顺从周礼，那就‘宛在水中央’、‘水中坻’、‘水中沚”，意思是治国有希望。”二是“招贤”说。姚际恒的《诗经通论》和方玉润的《诗经原始》都说这是一首招贤诗，“伊人”即“贤才”：“贤人隐居水滨，而人慕而思见之。”或谓：“征求逸隐不以其道，隐者避而不见。”三是“爱情”说。今人蓝菊有、杨任之、樊树云、高亭、吕恢文等均持“恋歌”说。如吕恢文说：“这是一首恋歌，由于所追求的心上人，可望而不可即，诗人陷入烦恼。说河水阻隔，是含蓄的隐喻。”\n由于此诗之本写之事无从查实，诗中的“伊人”所指亦难征信，故而以上三说均难以最终定论。在这里，我们姑且先把它当作一首爱情诗来解读。《蒹葭》属于《秦风》。周孝王时，秦之先祖非子受封于秦谷（今甘肃天水）。平王东迁时，秦襄公因出兵护送有功，又得到了岐山以西的大片封地。后来秦逐渐东徙，都于雍（今陕西兴平）。秦地包括陕西关中到甘肃东南部一带。秦风共十篇，大都是东周时代这个区域的民歌。\n文学赏析：东周时的秦地大致相当于今天的陕西大部及甘肃东部。其地“迫近戎狄”，这样的环境迫使秦人“修习战备，高尚气力”（《汉书·地理志》），而他们的情感也是激昂粗豪的。保存在《秦风》里的十首诗也多写征战猎伐、痛悼讽劝一类的事，似《蒹葭》、《晨风》这种凄婉缠绵的情致却更像郑卫之音的风格。\n诗中“白露为霜”给读者传达出节序已是深秋了，而天才破晓，因为芦苇叶片上还存留着夜间露水凝成的霜花。就在这样一个深秋的凌晨，诗人来到河边，为的是追寻那思慕的人儿，而出现在眼前的是弥望的茫茫芦苇丛，呈出冷寂与落寞，诗人所苦苦期盼的人儿在哪里呢？只知道在河水的另外一边。但这是一个确定性的存在吗？从下文看，并非如此。是诗人根本就不明伊人的居处，还是伊人像“东游江北岸，夕宿潇湘沚”的“南国佳人”（曹植《杂诗七首》之四）一样迁徙无定，也无从知晓。这种也许是毫无希望但却充满诱惑的追寻在诗人脚下和笔下展开。把“溯洄”、“溯游”理解成逆流而上和顺流而下或者沿着弯曲的水道和沿着直流的水道，都不会影响到对诗意的理解。在白居易《长恨歌）中，杨贵妃消殒马嵬坡后，玄宗孤灯独守，寒衾难眠，通过道士鸿都客“上穷碧落下黄泉”的寻找，仍是“两处茫茫皆不见”，但终究在“虚无缥缈”的海外仙山上找到了已成仙的杨贵妃，相约重逢于七夕。而《蒹葭》中，诗人一番艰劳的上下追寻后，伊人仿佛在河水中央，周围流淌着波光，依旧无法接近。《周南·汉广》中诗人也因为汉水太宽无法横渡而不能求得“游女”，陈启源说：“夫说（悦）之必求之，然惟可见而不可求，则慕说益至。”（《毛诗稽古编·附录》）“可见而不可求”，可望而不可即，加深着渴慕的程度。诗中“宛”字表明伊人的身影是隐约缥缈的，或许根本上就是诗人痴迷心境下生出的幻觉。以下两章只是对首章文字略加改动而成，这种仅对文字略加改动的重章叠唱是《诗经》中常用的手法。具体到此诗，这种改动都是在韵脚上——首章“苍、霜、方、长、央”属阳部韵，次章“凄、唏、湄、跻、坻”属脂微合韵，三章“采、已、涣、右、浊”属之部韵——如此而形成各章内部韵律协和而各章之间韵律参差的效果，给人的感觉是：变化之中又包涵了稳定。同时，这种改动也造成了语义的往复推进。如“白露为霜”、“白露未晞”、“白露未已”——夜间的露水凝成霜花，霜花因气温升高而融为露水，露水在阳光照射下蒸发——表明了时间的延续。\n此诗曾被认为是用来讥刺秦襄公不能用周礼来巩固他的国家（《毛诗序》、郑笺），或惋惜招引隐居的贤士而不可得（姚际恒《诗经通论》、方玉润《诗经原始》）。但跟《诗经》中多数诗内容往往比较具体实在不同，此诗并没有具体的事件与场景，甚至连“伊人”的性别都难以确指。上述两种理解也许当初是有根据的，但这些根据或者没有留存下来，或者不足以服人，因而他们的结论也就让人怀疑了。《诗经》的历代注家往往是求之愈深，却得到失之愈远的相反结果。况且“一切历史都是当代史”（见英国哲学家、历史学家科林伍德《历史观念》），对文本的阐释也具有当代性。现代大多数学者都把它看作是一首爱情诗，先以苍苍的蒹葭起兴，再写男子追求意中人，所追的人在何方?在茂密的蒹葭...","metadata":{"poem_id":"291","poet":"先秦
