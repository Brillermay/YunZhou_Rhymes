张说\n正文：客心争日月，来往预期程。\n秋风不相待，先至洛阳城。\n分类：抒情 秋风\n文学赏析：刘逸生\n此诗载于《全唐诗》卷八十九。下面是中华诗词学会理事、广东中华诗词学会名誉会长刘逸生先生对此诗的赏析。\n这首诗是张说在校书郎任内出使西川时写的，虽只寥寥二十字，却颇能看出他写诗的技巧和才华。\n一个接受任务到远地办事的人，总是怀着对亲人的眷恋，一到目的地，就掐指盘算着回归的日期，这种心情是很自然的。但张说能把这种幽隐的心情“发而为诗”，而且压缩在两句话里，却不简单。\n“客心争日月，来往预期程。”“客心”是旅外游子之心，“争日月”，象同时间进行一场争夺战。这“争”字实在写得好，把处在这种地位的游子的心情充分表露出来了。“来往预期程”，是申说自己所以“争日月”的缘故。公府的事都有个时间规定，那就要事先进行准备，作出计划，所以说是“预”。十个字把诗人当时面临的客观情况，心里的筹划、掂量，都写进去了，简炼明白，手法很高明。\n这十个字又是下文的伏笔。本来使蜀的日程安排是十分紧凑的，然而诗人回归之心更急切，他要力争按时回洛阳。他是洛阳人，在洛阳有家，预期回归，与家人团聚。\n下文忽然来个大转折：“秋风不相待，先至洛阳城。”不料情况突变，原定秋前赶回洛阳的希望落空了。游子之心，当然怅惘。然而诗人却有意把人的感情隐去，绕开一笔，埋怨起秋风来了：这秋风呵，也是够无情的，它就不肯等我一等，径自先回洛阳城去了。\n这一笔，妙在避开了率直无味的毛病，而且把人格化了的秋风形容为“无情的秋风”。这秋风先至，自然要引起许多烦恼。可以试想，秋风一至洛阳，亲人们必然要翘首企盼；而自己未能如约的苦衷就更不用说了。淡淡一笔，情致隽永深厚。\n在这里，诗人到底是埋怨秋风，还是抒发心中的烦恼？诗中没有明说，颇费人寻绎，正是所谓“含不尽之意见于言外”（欧阳修《六一诗话》）。不过可以想见，诗人对于这次情况的突然变化，确实感到意外，或有点不满，不过他用的是“含蓄”的语言罢了。\n张说早些时就写过一首《被使在蜀》诗：“即今三伏尽，尚自在临邛。归途千里外，秋月定相逢。”归期定在秋月，即此诗所谓“预期程”。不料时届秋令，秋风已起，比诗人“先至洛阳城”，他却落后了，即诗题所谓“后期”。秋风本是按时而起，无所谓“先”；只因诗人归期“后”了，便显出秋风的“先”来。两首合看，于诗中的情味当有更深的体会。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴蜀：今四川一带。\n⑵争日月：同时间竞争。\n⑶洛阳：当时的首都。武则天称帝后定都洛阳。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"3624","poet":"唐代
