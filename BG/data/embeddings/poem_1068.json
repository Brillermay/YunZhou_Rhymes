弃妇\n文学赏析：此诗塑造了一位地位虽有不同，但命运却与《卫风·氓》之主人公相似的可怜弃妇形象。她当初也许曾有过海誓山盟、夫妇相爱的短暂幸福。但随着秋来春往、珠黄色衰，“其心孔艰”（心思难测正如“氓”之“二三其德”、其心“罔极”）的丈夫，待她便“始者不如今”，粗暴取代了温柔，热恋化作了冷漠。丈夫回到家中，想到的只是上河梁去取鱼虾享用，而对操劳在室的妻子，则连“入”房中慰问一下的兴致都没有。他总是匆匆而来，又匆匆而去（大抵早已有了“外遇”罢）。说他事忙吧，他却能在庭中慢条斯理地油他的车；说他没事吧，却连“遑舍”（止息的闲暇）一夜的功夫都没有。好容易盼得他回来一次，却只给妻子留下暴虐相待的伤痛。想到命运之绳曾将自己和丈夫贯串在一起（“及尔如贯”），相互间理应亲如“埙”、“篪”相和的“伯”、“仲”（古时常以兄弟相亲喻夫妻相谐）；而今，丈夫竟连起码的夫妇之礼都不顾了，不能不激得女主人公悲愤难平。在长夜焦灼的“反侧”之中，她终于发出了愤切的诅咒：“为鬼为蜮，则不可得。有靦面目，视人罔极”——你真正是枉然生了一张人脸，心思的险恶莫测，简直胜过鬼蜮呵！\n从诗之结语“作此好歌（因为歌意涉及男女之情，故称），以极反侧”看，此歌作于女主人公长夜难眠的“反侧”之际。诗虽也带有相当的叙事成分，但脉络并不清晰。在充满疑云的反覆诘问中，展出“彼”人的飘忽身影，又穿插进回忆中的种种生活片断，使全诗的结构显得似断非断、散乱飘忽。如果要找一个适当的词汇来说明此诗的表现特点，那就是两个字——“梦幻”。而这，大抵正与女主人公作歌时的“反侧”难眠状况有关。从诗中透露的消息可知，那位薄情丈夫对女主人公的冷遇，无疑已天长日久。每当她望眼欲穿盼其归来时，丈夫却总是迟迟不归；就是归来，也行迹诡秘、形同飘风，出没于庭院、鱼粱之际，只顾着自身的享受，极少有入房与妻子叙叙的诚意。一对往日的燕尔夫妻，竟变得如同陌路之人。这些景象，当然会深深烙在女主人公脑际而难以抹去。因此，当她辗转反侧之际、神思恍惚之中，往事今情便可能全化作散乱的片断，梦幻般地涌现在眼前。此诗正适应了这一特定背景，采用叠章和问句、跳荡不定和迅速转换的意象，表现了女主人公似忆似梦间的疑惑与惊诧、痛愤和哀伤。进入女主人公梦思中的对象，明明是她丈夫，她却似乎不认识他，开篇即以“彼何人斯”相询，正绝妙地传达了这种神思恍惚中的迷乱之感。后文的“胡逝我梁，不入唁我”、“我闻其声，不见其身”，更以扑朔迷离之辞，表现了唯有幻梦才带有的视听和思虑特点。女主人公刚想细细审视，幻境却又一变，车影、语声竟化作一团“飘风”，忽东忽西地卷向鱼梁去了；但转眼间，她又似乎看到，丈夫分明还在庭中，正如往日那样悠然自得地“脂车”呢。梦境的飘忽变幻，伴随着女主人公神思恍惚间的疑惑、惊惧、失望和愤懑，一起化作诗行涌现，便产生了这首奇妙、独特的弃妇歌。\n现代译文：那到底是一个什么样人啊？我只知道他的心肠太阴险。他为什么偷偷去我的鱼梁，却不愿意迈进我家的门槛？请问这小哥你是谁的跟班？原来他是唯暴公马首是瞻。\n\n1.何人：什么人，不知其姓名。斯：语助词。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1068","poet":"先秦
