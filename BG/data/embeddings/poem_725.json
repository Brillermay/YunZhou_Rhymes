赞颂\n文学赏析：李白这一首《侠客行》古风，抒发了他对侠客的倾慕，对拯危济难、用世立功生活的向往。\n前四句从侠客的装束、兵刃、坐骑描写侠客的外貌。\n第二个四句写侠客高超的武术和淡泊名利的行藏。\n第三个四句引入信陵君和侯嬴、朱亥的故事来进一步歌颂侠客，同时也委婉地表达了自己的抱负。侠客得以结识明主，明主借助侠客的勇武谋略去成就一番事业，侠客也就功成名就了。\n最后四句表示，即使侠客的行动没有达到目的，但侠客的骨气依然流芳后世，并不逊色于那些功成名就的英雄，写史的人应该为他们也写上一笔。\n有人认为这首《侠客行》仅仅是写朱亥、侯嬴，是不对的。前八句写的侠客的形象就与朱、侯两人不符。朱并不会剑术，而是力气大、勇敢。侯主要是智谋取胜。一句“闲过信陵饮”不过是将侠客与信陵君这样的“明君”联系起来罢了，因朱、侯都不是以这种方式结识信陵君的。李白正是想结识像信陵君这样的明主以成就自己“申管晏之谈，谋帝王之术，奋其智能，愿为辅弼，使寰区大定，海县靖一”的政治抱负。\n前人有曰：借他人故事，浇自己块垒。李白这首诗亦当如是！\n我们知道，唐代游侠之风颇为盛行，这是与唐代西域交通发达，全国经济日益繁荣，城市商业兴旺的盛唐时代有关，所以，下仅是燕赵传统的多任侠而已。特别是关陇一带的风习“融胡汉为一体，文武不殊途。”（陈寅恪：《唐代政治史述论论稿》）更促成了少年喜剑术、尚任侠的风气。李白少年时代，颇受关陇文化风习的影响，因此，他自幼勤苦读书“观百家”外，“十五好剑术”（《与韩州书》）“高冠佩雄剑”（《忆襄阳旧游赠马少府巨》）甚至，他一生都不离剑的：“抚剑夜吟啸，雄心日千里。”（《赠张相镐》其二）“长剑一杯酒，男儿方寸心。”（《赠崔侍御》）堪称是“文武不殊途”，兼备于李白一身了。那么，诗人李白何以如此爱剑呢？这和他轻财重义，尚任侠分不开。他说；“十五好剑术，遍于诸侯。”正是当时任侠流行的社会意识，为了事业心和抱负的驱使，尚任侠的少年都企求干一番豪纵、快意的事，得到社会上的普遍赞誉。李白这首《侠客行》就是以这任侠意识为旨的。\n《侠客行》是诗人李白以夸张的笔墨，从游侠的服饰开始：“赵客缦胡缨，吴钩霜雪明。银鞍照白马，飒沓如流星。”仅二十个字，仿佛全是写物而不写人。但当时游侠儿的气势、风貌，就栩栩如生的展现在目前了。因为诗人并不是为物而夸张的写物，而是处处着眼于人的精神气势而写物。“缦胡”的“缨’，“霜雪明”的”吴钩”，“飒沓如流星”的“白马”这些当时流行的任侠服饰，不仅具有典型性，而且流露出主人豪纵、慷慨之气，把物都写活了。\n诗人进而写游侠的行为：“十步杀一人，千里不留行。事了拂衣去，深藏身与名。”也仅是二十字，就高度概括了排忧解难、不图名利、尚义气、重承诺等等的高尚人格。诗人是以“纵死侠骨香，不惭世上英”的思想，加以歌赞的。事实上，诗人之所以少好任侠，乃是以此为理想人格而向往的，故能把一般的任侠社会意识，写得如此深刻而生动。\n最后，诗人以战国时“窃符救赵夺晋鄙军”中的侯赢、朱亥”二壮士”例，阐明“纵死侠骨香，不惭世上英”之旨。“闲过信陵饮，脱剑膝前横。将炙啖朱亥，持觞劝侯赢。三杯吐然诺，五岳倒为轻。眼花耳热后，意气紫霓生。救赵挥金槌，邯郸先震惊。千秋二壮士，恒赫大梁城。纵死侠骨香，不惭世上英”这“三杯吐然诺，五岳为之轻。眼花耳热后，意气紫霓生。”重然诺，尚意气的任侠，真是“慷慨成素霓，啸咤起清风。”（张华《壮士篇》）的。震撼了大梁城：“千秋二壮士”，是当之而不愧。“不惭世上英”！诗人对“二壮士”叹服不已，情见于词了。\n然而，诗人不仅在热烈的颂唱“二壮士”，同时也对校书天禄阁草《太玄经》的扬雄辈，无情地加以蔑视：“谁能书阁下，白首《太玄经》”是为壮夫所不为！\n《侠客行》诗，虽在歌颂任侠，但由于诗人就是尚任侠的，所以把诗人少年的豪情壮志，表现无遗了。\n侠客一道，是中国文化自远古遗留下来的宝贵的文化基因。这个文化基因的作用是，对于体制的强权保持一种个人的挑战，无论是真正武力上的，还是思想上的，使得体制的强权无法控制一切，使得这个文化不会完全丧失活力。到了宋代之后，在长期的王权的压制下，这个基因已经在很大程度上休眠了；而到了近代，更是又来了强势的西方文明的压制，中国人吃饭、穿衣、一举手、一投足、一动念，都变得要想一想是否符合西方人的规范，是否有“绅士风度”。因此，侠客一道的文化基因在现代中国也是离死不远了。现今的中国人还是非常喜欢武侠小说和武侠电影，但如果你真仔细想想武侠小说和武侠电影里的侠客，你会发...","metadata":{"poem_id":"725","poet":"唐代
