张说\n正文：巴陵一望洞庭秋，日见孤峰水上浮。\n闻道神仙不可接，心随湖水共悠悠。\n分类：送别\n文学赏析：此诗载于《全唐诗》卷八十九。下面是李白研究学会理事、四川诗词学会理事、四川大学文学与新闻学院教授周啸天先生对此诗的赏析。\n严羽有一段论诗名言：“盛唐诗人惟在兴趣，羚羊挂角，无迹可求。故其妙处莹彻玲珑，不可凑泊，如空中之音，相中之色，水中之月，镜中之象，言有尽而意无穷。”（《沧浪诗话》）离了具体作品，这话似玄乎其玄；一当联系实际，便觉精辟深至。且以张说这首标志七绝进入盛唐的力作来解剖一下。\n这是送别之作。诗中送别之意，若不从兴象风神求之，那真是“无迹可求”的。\n谪居送客，看征帆远去，该是极其凄婉的怀抱（《唐才子传》谓张说“晚谪岳阳，诗益凄婉”）。“天涯一望断人肠”（孟浩然），首句似乎正要这么说。但只说到“巴陵一望”，后三字忽然咽了下去，成了“洞庭秋”，纯乎是即目所见之景了。这写景不渲染、不著色，只是简淡。然而它能令人联想到“袅袅兮秋风，洞庭波兮木叶下”（《楚辞·九歌·湘夫人》）的情景，如见湖上秋色，从而体味到“巴陵一望”中“目眇眇兮愁予”的情怀。这不是景中具意么，只是“不可凑泊”，难以寻绎罢了。\n气蒸云梦、波撼岳阳的洞庭湖上，有座美丽的君山，日日与它见面，感觉也许不那么新鲜。但在送人的今天看来，是异样的。说穿来就是愈觉其“孤”。否则何以不说“日见‘青山’水上浮”呢。若要说这“孤峰”就是诗人在自譬，倒未见得。其实何须用意，只要带了“有色眼镜”观物，物必著我之色彩。因此，由峰之孤足见送人者心情之孤。“诗有天机，待时而发，触物而成，虽幽寻苦索，不易得也”（《四溟诗话》），却于有意无意得之。\n关于君山传说很多，一说它是湘君姊妹游息之所（“疑是水仙梳洗处”），一说“其下有金堂数百间，玉女居之”（《拾遗记》），这些神仙荒忽之说，使本来实在的君山变得有几分缥缈。“水上浮”的“浮”字，除了表现湖水动荡给人的实感，也微妙传达这样一种迷离扑朔之感。\n诗人目睹君山，心接传说，不禁神驰。三句遂由实写转虚写，由写景转抒情。从字面上似离送别题意益远，然而，“闻道神仙——不可接”所流露的一种难以追攀的莫名惆怅，与别情当有微妙的关系。作者同时送同一人作的《岳州别梁六入朝》云：“梦见长安陌，朝宗实盛哉！”也有同一种钦羡莫及之情。送人入朝原不免触动谪宦之感，而去九重帝居的人，在某种意义上也算“登仙”。说“梦见长安陌”是实写，说“神仙不可接”则颇涉曲幻。羡仙乎？恋阙乎？“诗以神行，使人得其意于言之外，若远若近，若无若有”（屈绍隆《粤游杂咏》），这也就是所谓盛唐兴象风神的表现。\n神仙之说是那样虚无缥缈，洞庭湖水是如此广远无际，诗人不禁心事浩茫，与湖波俱远。岂止“神仙不可接”而已，眼前，友人的征帆已“随湖水”而去，变得“不可接”了，自己的心潮不禁随湖水一样悠悠不息。“心随湖水共悠悠”，这个“言有尽而意无穷”的结尾，令人联想到“惟见长江天际流”（李白），而用意更为隐然；叫人联想到“惟有相思似春色，江南江北送君归”（王维），比义却不那么明显。浓厚的别情浑融在诗境中，“如空中之音，相中之色，水中之月，镜中之象”，死扣不着，妙悟得出。借叶梦得的话来说，此诗之妙“正在无所用意，猝然与景相遇，借以成章，不假绳削，故非常情能到”（《石林诗话》）。\n胡应麟认为此诗“句格成就，渐入盛唐”，他所作的评价是公允的。七绝的“初唐标格”结句“多为对偶所累，成半律诗”（《升庵诗话》），此诗则通体散行，风致天然，“惟在兴趣”，全是盛唐气象了。作者张说不仅是开元名相，也是促成文风转变的关键人物。其律诗“变沈宋典整前则，开高岑后矫清规”，亦继往而开来。而此诗则又是七绝由初入盛里程碑式的作品。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴梁六：即梁知微，时为潭州（今湖南长沙）刺史，途径岳阳入朝。洞庭山：即君山，位于岳阳市西南的洞庭湖中，风景秀丽。\n⑵巴陵：郡名，即岳州，今湖南岳阳。\n⑶孤峰：指洞庭山，即君山。\n⑷神仙：指湘君、湘夫人等传说中的神仙。《拾遗记》：“其下有金堂数百间，玉女居之。”\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"3651","poet":"唐代
