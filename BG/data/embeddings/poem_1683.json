佚名\n正文：奕奕梁山，维禹甸之，有倬其道。\n韩侯受命，王亲命之：缵戎祖考，无废朕命。\n夙夜匪解，虔共尔位，朕命不易。\n榦不庭方，以佐戎辟。\n四牡奕奕，孔脩且张。\n韩侯入觐，以其介圭，入觐于王。\n王锡韩侯，淑旂绥章，簟茀错衡，玄衮赤舄，钩膺镂锡，鞹鞃浅幭，鞗革金厄。\n韩侯出祖，出宿于屠。\n显父饯之，清酒百壶。\n其肴维何？炰鳖鲜鱼。\n其蔌维何？维笋及蒲。\n其赠维何？乘马路车。\n笾豆有且。\n侯氏燕胥。\n韩侯取妻，汾王之甥，蹶父之子。\n韩侯迎止，于蹶之里。\n百两彭彭，八鸾锵锵，不显其光。\n诸娣从之，祁祁如云。\n韩侯顾之，烂其盈门。\n蹶父孔武，靡国不到。\n为韩姞相攸，莫如韩乐。\n孔乐韩土，川泽訏訏，鲂鱮甫甫，麀鹿噳噳，有熊有罴，有猫有虎。\n庆既令居，韩姞燕誉。\n溥彼韩城，燕师所完。\n以先祖受命，因时百蛮。\n王锡韩侯，其追其貊。\n奄受北国，因以其伯。\n实墉实壑，实亩实藉。\n献其貔皮，赤豹黄罴。\n分类：诗经 赞颂 写人\n文学赏析：全诗六章，章十二句，为整齐的四言体，每章内容各有重点，按人物的活动依次叙述，脉络连贯，层次清楚。\n首章从大禹开通九州，韩城有大道直通京师起笔，表明北方本属王朝疆域。通过周王亲自宣布册命和册命的内容，说明受封的韩侯应担负的重要政治任务以及周王所寄予的重大期望；任务和期望的根本之点，是作为王朝的屏障安定北方。\n第二章叙述韩侯觐见和周王给予赏赐，而这一切都依据礼法进行。呈介圭为贽表明韩侯的合法地位，周王的赏赐表示韩侯受到的优宠。周代以“礼”治国，“礼”就是法律和制度，按制度，周代贵族服饰车乘的质料、颜色、图案、式样、大小规格都有规定，不能僭越。周王赏赐的交龙日月图案的黑龙袍、红色木底高靴、特定规格的精美车辆，都是诸侯方伯使用的。由周王赏赐，类似后世的“授衔”和公布享受何种等级的待遇，它表明受赐者地位、权利的提高：年轻的韩侯一跃而为蒙受周王优宠、肩负重任的荣显人物。\n第三章叙述韩侯离京时由朝廷卿士饯行的盛况。出行祖祭是礼制，大臣衔命出京，例由朝廷派卿士在郊外饯行，这也是礼制。祖祭后出行，祭礼用清酒，所以饯行也“清酒百壶”，这仍是礼制。一切依礼制进行，又极尽宴席之丰盛。这些描写继续反映韩侯政治地位的重要及其享受的尊荣。\n第四章叙述韩侯迎亲。这一章铺陈女方高贵的出身家世和富贵繁华的迎亲场面，烘托出热烈的喜庆气氛，再现了贵族婚礼的铺张场景和风习，也表现了主人公的荣贵显耀。\n第五章重点叙述韩国土地富庶，河流湖泊密布，盛产水产品和珍贵毛皮。这些叙述从蹶父选婿引起，以韩姞满意作结，虽然叙述重点转移，却与上章紧紧钩连，不显突兀，收过渡自然之妙。\n第六章叙述韩侯归国，成为北方诸侯方伯，建韩城，施行政，统治百国，作王朝屏障，并贡献朝廷，与首章册命遥相呼应。\n全诗的主题是颂扬韩侯，颂扬他接受王国重要政治使命，肩负作为王国屏障安定北方的重任，表现周王的优宠和倚重，公卿对他的尊慕和礼敬，诗中渲染的他的富贵荣华以及他的权威，都与他的政治地位密切联系。没有他的政治地位和作用，一切都无从谈起。所以，这是一篇歌颂接受国家重任的大臣的颂歌。其中，饯宴、迎亲的场景描写，是诗中的插部，用以烘托主人公的高贵荣显，并使全诗波澜迭兴，有张有弛，有明有暗，有庄有雅。相映成趣。\n此诗颂美一个荣显的诸侯，却没有溢美之辞，而只是叙述事实，铺陈事物，或正面描述，或侧面烘托，落笔庄重大方，不涉谄谀，也不作空泛议论，这在颂诗中是特出的。\n全诗六章，各章重点突出，但前后钩连，结成一体；内容相对集中，而前后照应，首尾呼应，无割裂枝蔓之累，其结构亦可资借鉴。\n此诗的语言风格也变化多姿。首章叙述周王册命，其语言如《尚书》用语般典重古奥；第二章叙述周王赏赐，铺陈华丽，以见恩宠之隆；第三章以下间用叠词、口语，描写有声有色，写得生动活泼。一诗之中，语言风格三易，即俗谓“到什么山上唱什么歌”。\n现代译文：巍巍梁山多高峻，大禹曾经治理它，交通大道开辟成。韩侯来京受册命，周王亲自来宣布：继承你的先祖业，切莫辜负委重任。日日夜夜不懈怠，在职恭虔又谨慎，册命自然不变更。整治不朝诸方国，辅佐君王显才能。\n\n1.奕奕：高大貌。梁山：宣王时韩国境内山名。所在地诸说不一。郑笺据《汉书·地理志》谓“粱山在夏阳西北”；马瑞辰《毛诗传笺通释》引《潜夫论》谓：“昔周宣王亦有韩城，其国也近燕，故《诗》曰‘溥彼韩城，燕师所完”’，又引王肃云：“涿郡方城县有韩侯城”，又引《水经注》云：“方城今为顺天府固安县，在府西南百二十里。”按《大清一统志》：“韩城在固安县西南；《县志》今名韩侯营，在县东南十八里。”细审诗义，今人多从此说。据现行政区划，当在北京市通县之西，固安县之东北。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1683","poet":"先秦
