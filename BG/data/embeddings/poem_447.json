佚名\n正文：月出皎兮，佼人僚兮。\n舒窈纠兮，劳心悄兮。\n月出皓兮，佼人懰兮。\n舒忧受兮，劳心慅兮。\n月出照兮，佼人燎兮。\n舒夭绍兮，劳心惨兮。\n分类：诗经 月亮 怀人 民谣\n文学赏析：关于诗的主题，《毛诗序》认为是讽刺陈国统治者“好色”，朱熹《诗集传》谓“此亦男女相悦而相念之辞”。高亨《诗经今注》认为描绘“陈国统治者，杀害了一位英俊人物”。多认为是月下相思的爱情诗。\n诗从望月联想到意中女子的美丽，想起她的面容，想起她的身姿，想起她的体态，越思越忧，越忧越思……深沉的相思，美人的绰绝，月夜的优美，构成了动人情景，又别是一番诗情画意了。\n“月出皎兮”，天上一轮圆月洒着皎洁的银辉，这夜色显得格外的美丽。这是写景，也是写情。这句交待了诗人活动的背景是在一个月光明丽的夜晚，这本身就富有很大的魅力和诱惑力，容易使人对景生情，发出许多美好的联想。同时，结合下句，这句又有着比兴的作用，以月光的美来比喻所爱人的美，是很恰贴的。“佼人僚兮”反映出这时在诗人的眼前，出现了一个娇美的女子，引起他无限的爱慕和情思。天上有着皎洁的月光，地上有着娇美的女子，此时此刻，此情此景，花好月圆，天惬人意。“舒窈纠兮”一句写诗人仔细端详女子时的感觉。在月光下，她不但显得容貌皎好，而且身材那么苗条、秀美，真让人神颠魄荡；而更吸引人的，是她还有一种气质美，她举止舒缓，雍容大方，性情安静，而这气比外表更富有魅力。“劳心悄兮”，此句是诗人自言其心情的烦闷。月光美，人更美，那窈窕的身姿象那雍容的举止，使得诗人一见钟情，而又无从表白，因而生发出无限的忧愁和感慨。\n这首诗的景色描写很有特色，“月出皎兮”，“月出皓兮”，“月出照兮”，柔美的月光本身就有无限的情意，而让它作为背景来衬托，则女子的倩影愈发显得秀美。同时，月光朦胧下，一个线条优美的女子在缓缓起步，更增添了几分神秘的色彩，有一种朦胧美的韵味。所以，这一景色很富有画意，而画意又渗透了无限的诗情。\n《月出》的意境是迷离的。诗人思念他的情人，是从看到冉冉升起的皎月开始的。也许因为月儿总是孤独地悬在无垠的夜空，也许因为它普照一切，笼盖一切，所谓“隔千里兮共明月”（谢庄《月赋》），月下怀人的作品总给人以旷远的感觉。作者的心上人，此刻也许就近在咫尺，但在这朦胧的月光下，又似乎离得很远很远，真是“美人如花隔云端”（李白《长相思》）。诗人“虚想”着她此刻姣好的容颜，她月下踟躅的婀娜倩影，时而分明，时而迷茫，如梦似幻。[3]\n《月出》的情调是惆怅的。全诗三章中，如果说各章前三句都是从对方设想，末后一句的“劳心悄兮”、“劳心慅兮”、“劳心惨兮”，则是直抒其情。这忧思，这愁肠，这纷乱如麻的方寸，都是在前三句的基础上产生，都由“佼人”月下的倩影诱发，充满可思而不可见的怅恨。其实这怅恨也已蕴含在前三句中：在这静谧的永夜，“佼人”月下独自地长久地徘徊，一任夜风拂面，一任夕露沾衣，她也是在苦苦地思念着自己。这真是“此时相望不相闻，愿逐月华流照君”（张若虚《春江花月夜》）。\n与迷茫的意境和惆怅的情调相适应。《月出》的语言是柔婉缠绵的。通篇各句皆以感叹词“兮”收尾，这在《诗经》中并不多见。“兮”的声调柔婉、平和，连续运用，正与无边的月色、无尽的愁思相协调，使人觉得一唱三叹，余味无穷。另外，形容月色的“皎”、“皓”、“照”，形容容貌的“僚”、“懰”、“燎”，形容体态的“窈纠”、“懮受”、“夭绍”，形容心情的“悄”、“慅”、“惨”，可谓一韵到底，犹如通篇的月色一样和谐。其中“窈纠”、“懮受”、“夭绍”俱为叠韵词，尤显缠绵婉约。\n望月怀人的迷离意境和伤感情调一经《月出》开端，后世的同类之作便源源不断，李白《送祝八》“若见天涯思故人，浣溪石上窥明月”，杜甫《梦太白》“落月满屋梁，犹疑见颜色”，常建《宿王昌龄隐处》“松际露微月，清光犹为君”，王昌龄《送冯六元二》“山月出华阴，开此河渚雾，清光比故人，豁然展心悟”，此类甚多，大抵出自《陈风》。不管它们如何变换着视角，变换着形式，变换着语言，但似乎都只是一种意境，一种情调，即迷离的意境，怅惘的情调。这种意境与情调，最早也可以追溯到《月出》。这些滥觞于《月出》的望月怀人诗赋作品，总能使人受到感动与共鸣，这也正如月亮本身，终古常见，而光景常新。\n现代译文：月亮出来多明亮，美人仪容真漂亮。身姿窈窕步轻盈，让我思念心烦忧。\n\n⑴皎：毛传：“皎，月光也。”谓月光洁白明亮。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"447","poet":"先秦
