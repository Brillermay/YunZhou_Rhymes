佚名\n正文：天生烝民，有物有则。\n民之秉彝，好是懿德。\n天监有周，昭假于下。\n保兹天子，生仲山甫。\n仲山甫之德，柔嘉维则。\n令仪令色，小心翼翼。\n古训是式，威仪是力。\n天子是若，明命使赋。\n王命仲山甫，式是百辟，缵戎祖考，王躬是保。\n出纳王命，王之喉舌。\n赋政于外，四方爰发。\n肃肃王命，仲山甫将之。\n邦国若否，仲山甫明之。\n既明且哲，以保其身。\n夙夜匪解，以事一人。\n人亦有言，柔则茹之，刚则吐之。\n维仲山甫，柔亦不茹，刚亦不吐。\n不侮矜寡，不畏强御。\n人亦有言，德輶如毛，民鲜克举之。\n我仪图之，维仲山甫举之。\n爱莫助之。\n衮职有阙，维仲山甫补之。\n仲山甫出祖。\n四牡业业。\n征夫捷捷，每怀靡及。\n四牡彭彭，八鸾锵锵。\n王命仲山甫，城彼东方。\n四牡骙骙，八鸾喈喈。\n仲山甫徂齐，式遄其归。\n吉甫作诵，穆如清风。\n仲山甫永怀，以慰其心。\n分类：诗经 离别\n文学赏析：这首诗；《毛诗序》谓“美”，郝敬谓“讽”，二说视角不同，自然见解相反，然也有共同点，那就是皆着眼于此诗的言外之意，非诗中的基本内容。见仁见智，各有所取，此姑且不论，如果就诗说诗，当以朱熹说为胜。\n此诗首章起句不凡。开头四句郑重提出“人性”这一命题，哲理意味甚浓。前人多认为这是最早的“性善论”，故孟子在《告子章》中引此四句与孔子的阐释作为论“性善”的理论依据。但从全诗考察，似乎诗人并不是倡导什么“性善论”，他只不过是借天赋予人以善性，为下文歌颂仲山甫张本。第一章颂扬仲山甫应天运而生，非一般人物可比，总领全诗。接下去二至六章便不遗余力赞美仲山甫的德才与政绩：首先说他有德，遵从古训，深得天子的信赖；其次说他能继承祖先事业，成为诸侯典范，是天子的忠实代言人；再次说他洞悉国事，明哲忠贞，勤政报效周王；继而说他个性刚直，不畏强暴，不欺弱者；进而回应前几章，说他德高望重，关键靠自己修养，不断积累，因而成了朝廷补衮之臣。诗人对仲山甫推崇备至，极意美化，塑造了一位德才兼备、身负重任、忠于职守、攸关国运的名臣形象。七、八两章才转到正题，写仲山甫奉王命赴东方督修齐城，尹吉甫临别作诗相赠，安慰行者，祝愿其功成早归。全诗基调虽是对仲山甫个人的颂扬与惜别，但透过诗中关于仲山甫行事与心理的叙述，从中大体能体察到处于西周衰世的贵族，对中兴事业艰难的认识与隐忧，以及对力挽狂澜的辅弼大臣的崇敬与呼唤。不难理解，此诗对仲山甫的种种赞美，是真实的、现实的，然而也不排除其中有某些理想化的成分，包含着诗人所代表的这一阶层的期盼。有人斥此篇为“谀词”，似乎过苛。\n此诗主要以赋叙事，开篇以说理领起；中间夹叙夹议，突出仲山甫之德才与政绩；最后偏重描写与抒情，以热烈的送别场面作结，点出赠别的主题。全诗章法整饬，表达灵活，为后世送别诗之祖。在《诗经》中此篇说理成分比较浓厚，在诗歌发展史上留下重要的一笔，后世“以理为诗”当溯源于此。此诗语言也很有特色，尽管多用说理、议论，却不迂腐呆滞，这除了诗人的激情之外，还在于语言运用独具匠心，诗人多以民间俗语入诗，如表现仲山甫扶弱锄强的性格特征、赞美仲山甫重视修身立德，都是反用俗语来衬托，这比直说简洁、形象，又有理趣，说理中注进了诗味，故姚际恒称此为“奇语”（《诗经通论》）。诗中一些形象生动、富有哲理的语言，有的经后人使用或提炼，至今仍活在人们口头，如“小心翼翼”、“明哲保身”、“爱莫能助”、“穆如清风”等。善用虚词与叠字词本是《诗经》的语言特点，此篇独特之处是“之”字的运用，全诗十二个“之”字，用于句尾的有九个，其中第六章连用五个“之”字收句，娓娓道来，委婉有致，起到了特有的抒情效果，姚际恒指出“多用‘之’字，见缠绵之态”（《诗经通论》）。第十、八两章连用“业业”、“捷捷”、“锵锵”、“彭彭”、“骙骙”、“喈喈”等叠字词，铺叙送行场面的壮观和行动的迅捷，绘声绘色，增强了诗的形象性与节奏感。此诗押韵复杂，除五、六两章用一韵外，其余各章皆用两韵，韵脚也变化不定，如第一章则、德为韵，下、甫为韵；而第二章德、则、色、翼、式、力为韵，若、赋为韵；第三章考、保为韵，舌、发为韵；几乎无规则可循，后五章也是如此。\n现代译文：老天生下这些人，有着形体有法则。人的常性与生来，追求善美是其德。上天临视周王朝，昭明之德施于下。保佑这位周天子，有仲山甫辅佐他。\n\n1.烝（zhēng）民：意即庶民，泛指百姓，是春秋战国时代及之前历代对“百姓”的称谓。烝：众。物、则：严粲《诗缉》谓“天生烝民具形而有物，禀性而有则”。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1672","poet":"先秦
