佚名\n正文：猗与漆沮，潜有多鱼。\n有鳣有鲔，鲦鲿鰋鲤。\n以享以祀，以介景福。\n分类：诗经 祭祀 写鱼\n创作背景：《周颂·潜》是记述春祭供鱼盛况的乐歌。《毛诗序》云：“《潜》，季冬荐鱼，春献鲔也。”按此说法，这首诗所写的祭祀按时间分有两种，供奉鱼的品种亦不同。关于鱼的品种，孔疏的解释是：“冬则众鱼皆可荐，故总称鱼；春唯献鲔而已，故特言鲔。”\n漆、沮二水是周王朝发展史上一个重要的印记。据《史记·周本纪》载，公刘“自漆、沮渡渭，取材用，行者有资，居者有畜积，民赖其庆。百姓怀之，多徙而保归矣。周道之兴自此始。”周颂中的作品很少提及具体地名，而提及具体地名即与祭祀对象有关，如《周颂·天作》言“天作高山”，高山即岐山，是大王（即古公亶父）率民迁居之所，《诗集传》认为“此祭大王之诗”（大王亦曾渡漆、沮，但在公刘之后，所以以岐山为标志）。与《周颂·潜》不同的是，《周颂·天作》点明了“大王荒之”。《周颂·潜》诗中没有写出公刘，但公刘是周道由之而兴的关键人物，他在漆沮的经历当是周人熟知的典故，《周颂·潜》的祭祀对象必然是公刘，无须点出而自明。由此亦可知，周人赞美漆沮，不仅是基于二水的美丽富饶，更是带着强烈自豪的主观色彩。\n文学赏析：《周颂·潜》是专用鱼类为供品的祭祀诗。从诗中所写的鱼的数量之多（“潜有多鱼”）、品种之繁（“有鳣有鲔，鲦鲿鰋鲤”）以及人们对鱼类品种的熟知，可以看出当时渔业的卓有成效。潜置于水底，这种再简单不过的柴草堆作用却不可小觑，正是它们吸引了鱼类大军的聚集。这种原始而有效的养鱼方法也许就出自公刘时代，《史记·周本纪》中写及公刘“行地宜”，以潜养鱼可能正是因地制宜的创造性生产措施。祭祀诗离不开歌功颂德，《周颂·潜》明写了对漆、沮二水风景资源的歌颂，对公刘功德的歌颂则潜藏于字里行间，如同“潜”的设置，荡漾着透出波纹的韵味。\n“以（鱼）享以（鱼）祀，以介景福”是饮水思源、祈求福佑的祭祀行动。如果将鱼换成其他的祭品，祭祀的意蕴就会大受损害，而诗作一气呵成的效果也便丧失无遗。在这首诗中，鱼实在是必然贯穿到底的。最后一句虽然没有写出鱼，但鱼依然存在，因为“鱼”与“余”谐音。《周颂·潜》诗所写的祭祀季冬一次，隔年之春又一次，均用鱼，这便有理由推断：时至今日仍然广泛流传的“年年有鱼（余）”年画，民间除夕席上对鱼不动筷而让它完整地留进新年的习俗，和《周颂·潜》所描写的祭祀是一脉相承的。《周颂·潜》应当被视为民俗史上一条重要资料，它的末句所祈之福就是“余”。\n《周颂·潜》篇幅简短，却罗列了六种鱼名；漆、沮二水具体写出，却让祭祀对象公刘隐名；写王室的祭祀活动，却也与民间风俗息息相关。这些，都显示了作者调动艺术手法的匠心，使本来在《诗经》里相对枯燥的颂诗中的一首能够进入形象生动、意蕴丰富、趣味盎然的作品行列。\n现代译文：美好漆水和沮水，多种鱼类在栖息。有那鳣鱼和鲔鱼，还有鲦鲿和鰋鲤。用来祭祀献祖先，求得福祉永绵延。\n⑴猗（yī）与：赞美之词。漆沮（jù）：两条河流名，均在今陕西省渭河以北。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1905","poet":"先秦
