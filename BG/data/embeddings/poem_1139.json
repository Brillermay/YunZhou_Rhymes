佚名\n正文：大田多稼，既种既戒，既备乃事。\n以我覃耜，俶载南亩。\n播厥百谷，既庭且硕，曾孙是若。\n既方既皂，既坚既好，不稂不莠。\n去其螟螣，及其蟊贼，无害我田稚。\n田祖有神，秉畀炎火。\n有渰萋萋，兴雨祈祈。\n雨我公田，遂及我私。\n彼有不获稚，此有不敛穧，彼有遗秉，此有滞穗，伊寡妇之利。\n曾孙来止，以其妇子。\n馌彼南亩，田畯至喜。\n来方禋祀，以其骍黑，与其黍稷。\n以享以祀，以介景福。\n分类：诗经 祭祀\n文学赏析：全诗四章，其中第三章最重要也最精采，其他各章如众星之拱月，绿叶之衬花。第三章实写丰收，前二章起铺垫作用，末章是祭祀套话式的余波。\n农业丰收不是从天而降神赐的。诗首章追叙了对春耕的高度重视与精心准备。起句“大田多稼”虽是平淡的直赋其事，然而画面雄阔，涵盖了下文春耕夏耘秋收种种繁复场景，为之提供了纵情挥写的大舞台，气势不凡。由此可窥见当时绝非是一家一户的小农经济，而是井田制下的原始大生产耕作。第二句“既种既戒”，实是抓住了农业生产的“牛鼻子”，即选择良种与修缮农具。有了良种，播种的“百谷”才能“既庭且硕”；而工欲善其事，必先利其器，所以农奴以“覃耜”去犁田，才能收到事半功倍之效。“覃耜”只是“既戒”工作的举隅，其它可以想见。除了选种与修具外，还需有其他一系列次要的准备工作，诗用“既备乃事”一笔带过，笔墨精简，疏而不漏。用三个“既”字表示准备工作完成，干脆利落，要言不烦。末句冒出“曾孙是若”，好像很突兀，其实有非常紧密的内在联系。“曾孙”是当时政治、经济舞台的主角，也是此篇的核心人物，农奴一切卖力的活动都是为了顺应“曾孙”的欢心。春耕开局不错，最愉悦的人，当然是主角“曾孙”。这句客观上明确无误地展示了当时社会的主奴关系。从全篇看，第四章曾孙将出场巡视和主祭，这里先提一句作伏笔，也起到了贯通全篇血脉的作用，所谓着一子而满盘皆活。\n次章追叙夏耘，即田间管理，主要写除杂草与去虫害。播种后倘让作物自生自灭，那秋收就很渺茫，因此必须加强管理，而且要贯穿百谷成长的全过程。“既方既皁，既坚既好。”四个“既”像电影中的慢镜头特写，将作物阶段性生长的典型画面作了逐步推进的忠实记录，很有农业科学性，不谙农事的人是很难如此简练精确表述的。而“不稂不莠”却是关键句，即除尽了稂莠，才使粮食长势旺盛，这是略去了种种艰辛劳动过程而提炼出来的重要经验。另一条经验是灭虫。百谷有螟螣蟊贼以及蝗虫等许多天敌，如果不加清除，“田稚”难保，也许会导致粮食颗粒无收。除虫的办法，主要用火攻。让害虫在“炎火”中葬生。由于虫害在一定程度上不像除草那样可以完全由人工加以控制，所以先民又搬出了被称作“田祖”的农神，祈求田祖的神灵将虫害去尽。虽然带有迷信色彩，反映了当时生产力的低下，但也表现了农夫们的迫切愿望。《诗经》中此处提到的除虫方法，后世继续奉行沿用，典型例子是唐代姚崇驱蝗。开元四年（716年），山东蝗虫大起，姚崇奏道：“《毛诗》云：‘秉彼蟊贼，以付炎火。’……蝗既解飞，夜必赴火。夜中设火，火边掘坑，且焚且瘗，除之可尽。”（《旧唐书·姚崇传》）于是遣使分道杀蝗，终于扑灭虫害，保住庄稼。这明显是受了《小雅·大田》诗的启发。\n如果说上二章写的是尽人事，那么天时对于农业也至关重要，所以第三章前四句就写了风调雨顺情况。阴云弥漫，细雨绵绵，真是好雨知时节，“随风潜入夜，润物细无声”，公田、私田都有充沛雨水。外界景观与内心感受打成一片，农夫的喜悦在这四句中表现得淋漓尽致，从“公田”、“私田”的先后关系中，展现了社会矛盾缓和时期农夫们的忠悃厚道心情，在特定历史条件下，那是非常真率自然的。\n三章其余五句写丰产丰收。若从正面写，谷穗金黄一片，农夫挥汗如雨干得热火朝天，肩挑车载沉甸甸，大囤小囤满满装，也可以写得沸沸扬扬，动人心目，但那毕竟是寻常蹊径，易于雷同俗套。此诗之妙在于侧写，在于烘托，在于细节描写，不写收，而写不收，从不收中反映丰收，构思之妙，令人拍案叫绝。你看，有长得欠壮实故意不割的，有割了来不及捆束的，有已捆束而来不及装载的，还有许多飘洒散落在各处的谷穗。这些镜头读者闭目想像一下，是丰收还是歉收，不言而喻。至于怎么个丰收法，那就由读者各自去驰骋想像。该实的地方却留下一片空白，让人自行补充，这才是炉火纯青的艺术妙谛。对于此点，历代论者均赞赏不已。\n三章的末句“伊寡妇之利”，又使诗的意境得到升华。如果没有这末句，人们或会有疑问：大田里散落漏收那么多粮食，是不是农夫们偷懒和不珍惜呢？也或会作如是想。有了脱颖而出的此句，人们才恍然意识到农夫们故意不收割殆尽是有良苦用心的。为了让鳏寡孤独无依无靠者糊口活命，又免于他们沿街挨户乞讨的窘辱，农人有意留下一小部分丰收果实让他们自行去采拾，那种细腻熨贴，那种宅心仁厚，体现了中华民族自古有拯溺帮困的恻隐之心，那是一种宽广胸怀和崇高美德，至今读来仍令人感动不已。此诗中的“寡妇”，比之唐代杜荀鹤诗中写到兵荒马乱时世的“山中寡...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1139","poet":"先秦
