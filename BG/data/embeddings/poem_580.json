佚名\n正文：鸱鸮鸱鸮，既取我子，无毁我室。\n恩斯勤斯，鬻子之闵斯。\n迨天之未阴雨，彻彼桑土，绸缪牖户。\n今女下民，或敢侮予？\n予手拮据，予所捋荼。\n予所蓄租，予口卒瘏，曰予未有室家。\n予羽谯谯，予尾翛翛，予室翘翘。\n风雨所漂摇，予维音哓哓！\n分类：诗经 写鸟 寓理 哲理\n文学赏析：寓言是一种借说故事以寄寓人生感慨或哲理的特殊表现方式。它的主角可以是现实中人，也可以是神话、传说中的虚幻人物，而更多的则是自然界中的虫鱼鸟兽、花草木石。这种表现方式，在战国的诸子百家之说中曾被广为运用，使古代的说理散文增添了动人的艺术魅力，放射出奇异的哲理光彩。\n但以寓言作诗，在先秦却不多见；只是到了汉代，才在乐府诗中成批涌现，一时蔚为奇观。倘要追溯它的源头，虽然可与战国诸子之作遥相接续，但其“天造草昧”的创制，还得首推这首在“诗三百篇”中也属凤毛麟角的《鸱鸮》。\n这首诗的主角，是一头孤弱无助的母鸟。当它在诗中出场的时候，正是恶鸟“鸱鸮”刚刚洗劫了它的危巢，攫去了雏鸟在高空得意盘旋之际。诗之开笔“鸱鸮鸱鸮，既取我子，无毁我室”，即以突发的呼号，表现了母鸟目睹“飞”来横祸时的极度惊恐和哀伤。人们常说：“画为无声诗，诗为有声画。”此章的展开正是未见其影先闻其“声”，在充斥诗行的怆然呼号中，幻化出母鸟飞归、子去巢破的悲惨画境。当母鸟仰对高天，发出凄厉呼号之际，人们能体会到它此刻该怎样毛羽愤竖、哀怒交集。但鸱鸮之强梁，又不是孤弱的母鸟所可惩治的。怆怒的呼号追着鸱鸮之影远去，留下的便只有“恩斯勤斯，鬻子之闵斯”的伤心呜咽了。这呜咽传自寥廓无情的天底，传自风高巢危的树顶，而凝聚在两行短短的诗中，至今读来令人颤栗。\n正如人们很少关注鸟兽的悲哀一样，人类也很少能了解它们在面对灾祸时的伟大、坚强。诗中的母鸟看似孤弱，却也一样富于生存的勇气和毅力。它刚还沉浸在丧子破巢的哀伤之中，即又于哀伤中抬起了刚毅的头颅：“迨天之未阴雨，彻彼桑土，绸缪牖户。”它要趁着天晴之际，赶快修复破巢。这第二章仍以母鸟自述的口吻展开，但因为带有叙事和描摹，读者所读见的，便恍如镜头摇转式的特写画面：哀伤的母鸟急急忙忙，忽而飞落在桑树林间，啄剥着桑皮根须；忽而飞返树顶，口衔着韧须细细缠缚窠巢。“彻彼”叙其取物之不易，“绸缪”状其缚结之紧密。再配上“啾啾”啼鸣的几声“画外音”，读者便又听到了母鸟忙碌之后，所发出的既警惕又自豪的宣言：“今女下民，或敢侮予！”那是对饱经骚扰的下民往事的痛愤回顾，更是对缚扎紧密的鸟巢的骄傲自许，当然也包含着对时或欺凌鸟儿的“下民”的严正警告。倘若人类真能解破鸟语，是应该谨记这母鸟的警告，而对它的坚韧、顽强肃然起敬的了。\n三、四两章宜作一节读。这是母鸟辛勤劳作后的痛定思痛，更是对无法把握自身命运的处境的凄凄泣诉，“予手拮据”、“予口卒瘏”、“予羽谯谯”、“予尾翛翛”：遭受奇祸的母鸟终于重建了自己的巢窠，充满勇气地活了下来。但是，这坚强的生存，对于孤弱的母鸟来说，是付出了无比巨大的代价。\n它的鸟爪拘挛了，它的喙角累病了，至于羽毛、羽尾，也全失去了往日的细密和柔润，而变得稀疏、枯槁。这些怆楚的自怜之语，发之于面临奇灾大祸，而挣扎着修复鸟巢的万般艰辛之后，正如潮水之汹涌，表现着一种悲从中来的极大伤痛。然而更令母鸟恐惧的，还是挟带着自然威力的“风雨”：鸱鸮的进犯纵然可以凭非凡的勇气抵御，但对这天地间之烈风疾雨，小小的母鸟却无回天之力了。“予室翘翘，风雨所漂摇，予维音晓哓！”诗之结句，正以一声声“哓哓”的鸣叫，穿透摇撼天地的风雨，喊出了不能掌握自身命运的母鸟之哀伤。\n倘若仅从诗面上看，《鸱鸮》也堪称一首代鸟写悲的杰作：它写鸟像鸟，通篇用了母鸟的“语言”，逼真地传写出了既丧爱雏、复遭巢破的鸟禽之伤痛，塑造了一头虽经灾变仍不折不挠重建“家室”的可敬母鸟的形象。如果鸟禽有知，亦当为诗人对它们生活情状描摹之精妙、心理情感体味之真切，而“啾啾”叹惋。然而这毕竟是一首“寓言诗”，与其说是代鸟写悲，不如说是借鸟写人，那母鸟所受恶鸮的欺凌而丧子破巢的遭遇，以及在艰辛生存中面对不能把握自身命运的深深恐惧，正是下层人民悲惨情状的形象写照。由此反观全诗，则凶恶的“鸱鸮”、无情的“风雨”，便全可在人世中显现其所象征的真实身份。而在母鸟那惨怛的呼号和凄怆的哀诉中，正传达着久远以来受欺凌、受压迫人们的不尽痛愤。\n旧说如《毛诗序》谓此诗乃“周公救乱”之作，方玉润《诗经原始》、魏源《诗古微》又以为乃“周公悔过以儆成王”、“周公戒成王”之作，虽也知诗用借喻手法，但坐实本事，反而扞格不通。\n《鸱鸮》，周公救乱也。成王未知周公之志，公乃为诗以遗王，名之曰《鸱鸮》焉。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"580","poet":"先秦
