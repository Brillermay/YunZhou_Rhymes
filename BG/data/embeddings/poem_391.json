佚名\n正文：衡门之下，可以栖迟。\n泌之洋洋，可以乐饥。\n岂其食鱼，必河之鲂？岂其取妻，必齐之姜？\n岂其食鱼，必河之鲤？岂其取妻，必宋之子？\n分类：诗经 爱情 哲理\n文学赏析：许多解诗者认为此诗乃隐者表述安贫乐道之词。如朱熹《诗集传》云：“此隐居自乐而无求者之词。言衡门虽浅陋，然亦可以游息；泌水虽不可饱，然亦可以玩乐而忘饥也。”姚际恒《诗经通论》云：“此贤者隐居甘贫而无求于外之诗。一章甘贫也，二三章无求也。唯能甘贫，故无求。唯能无求，故甘贫。”这一观点即使不像闻一多先生所言“未免太可笑了”（《说鱼》），至少也有些酸腐。盖因此论带有明显的儒道杂糅的思想痕迹，是深受儒道思想影响的后世文人以六经注我的产物。这一观点与上古民歌的创作实情格格不入，正如《康衢谣》、《击壤歌》明显地属后世文人假托原始歌谣一样。让上古民歌谈安贫乐道未免有些滑稽。\n倒是闻一多先生从民俗学角度考释此诗兴象，认为当属情诗的看法较为贴切。按闻先生意见，“衡门之下”乃男女幽会之所，与《邶风·静女》中的“俟我于城隅”如出一辄；泌水之岸，乃男欢女爱之地，“泌”与密同，在山曰密，在水曰泌，都“是行秘密之事的地方”；“饥”亦非指腹饥，而是性之饥渴；更关键的是，“鱼”在上古是“匹偶”、“情侣”的隐语，“食鱼”所暗示的恰是男女的“合欢或结配”（闻先生的观点见《说鱼》、《高唐神女传说之分析》）。由是，则诗意已明：\n夕阳已逝，月上柳梢，一双青年男女悄悄来到城门下密约幽会，一番卿卿我我的甜言蜜语之后，激情促使他们双双相拥，又来到郊外河边，伴着哗哗的流水，极尽男欢女爱。或许小伙儿被这难忘良宵所陶醉，竟发表了一段富有哲理的爱情名言：吃鱼何必一定要黄河中的鲂鲤，娶妻又何必非齐姜、宋子不可？只要是两情相悦，谁人不可以共渡美好韶光？言外之意是，他与眼前的女子情感甚笃，非常满意，希望娶她为妻。此诗虽然短促，简单，但表现了上古陈地百姓自由、纯朴的情爱意识，正如民歌中唱的：“风过岭头水过基，男从女愿莫讲离。我俩有情吃水饱，无情吃肉也皱眉。”\n此诗在章法上也较独特，先是叙事，由叙事引发议论。“兴”没有放在诗首，而是放在议论之前，且与所兴之事又共同构成旨意相同的议论，使议论充满了形象感而未流于枯燥，加厚了诗意。\n《陈风》中多为情诗，说明陈地人民非常善于歌唱爱情。因此，能在这片土地上诞生这样一首富有哲理的情歌，也就不足为奇了。\n现代译文：\n\n\n①衡门：衡，通“横”，毛传：“衡门，横木为门，言浅陋也。”又闻一多《风诗类钞》曰：“东西为横，衡门疑陈城门名。”\n②可以：一说何以。栖迟：栖息，安身，此指幽会。\n③泌（bì）：泌：“泌”与“密”同，均为男女幽约之地，在山边曰密，在水边曰泌，故泌水为一般的河流，而非确指。\n④乐饥：隐语，《诗经》中常将性的欲望称为饥，乐饥指满足性的饥渴。闻一多《神话与诗·高唐神女传说之分析》：“其实称男女大欲不遂为‘朝饥’，或简称‘饥’，是古代的成语。”\n⑤岂：难道。\n⑥河：黄河。\n⑦齐之姜：齐国的姜姓美女。姜姓在齐国为贵族。\n⑧宋之子：宋国的子姓女子。子姓在宋国为贵族。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"391","poet":"先秦
