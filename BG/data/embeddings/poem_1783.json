佚名\n正文：天作高山，大王荒之。\n彼作矣，文王康之。\n彼徂矣，岐有夷之行。\n子孙保之。\n分类：诗经 赞颂 写山 写人\n创作背景：这是周人祭祀岐山的乐歌。对于周人来说，岐山是一圣地：“周之兴也，鸑鷟（yuè zhuó即凤凰）鸣于岐山。”（《国语·周语》）周人一系传至古公亶父，居于豳地，“薰育戎狄攻之，欲得财物，予之；已复攻，欲得地与民。民皆怒，欲战。古公曰：‘有民立君，将以利之。今戎狄所为攻战，以吾地与民。民之在我与其在彼何异？民欲以我故战，杀人父子而君之，予不忍为。’乃与私属去豳，度漆、沮。豳人举国扶老携弱，尽复归古公于岐下。及他旁国闻古公仁，亦多归之。”（《史记·周本纪》）古公之前，后稷、公刘二位也是功勋卓著，《国语》之所以取岐山为周人兴起的圣地，似是极度推崇古公亶父之仁，从上引文可见，古公亶父不仅仁爱本族，而且推仁爱于一再侵犯于己的异族，自然更是难能可贵，因而也更具备后世儒家所定的圣人品格。\n《周颂·天作》是周颂中少有的提及具体地点的作品（另一篇是《周颂·潜》），它写出了岐山。《毛诗序》说它是“祀先王先公”，朱熹《诗集传》则指为“祭大王之诗”，都认为祭祀的对象是人。姚际恒《诗经通论》引季明德语，认为是“岐山之祭”，即《周颂·天作》的祭祀对象是岐山。其实，岐山是古公亶父至周文王历代周主开创经营的根据地，其后的伐商灭纣便是在此积蓄了力量。《周颂·天作》这首诗，应该既是祭圣地，同时又是祭开创经营圣地的贤明君主的。由于岐山之业为古公亶父开创，而周文王后来由此迁都于丰，故《周颂·天作》应是在岐山对古公亶父至周文王历代君主进行祭祀的诗。至于行祭之人，则非周文王的继承人周武王莫属。\n文学赏析：这是一首歌颂周太王古公亶父开创岐山基业以及周文王业绩的短乐章。“天作高山”，强调上天赐予岐山这块圣地。周人重视天赐，视为吉祥，连婚娶亦是如此：“文王初载，天作之合。”（《大雅·大明》）天赐岐山之后，在这根据地上积蓄力量尚须人为，诗中便主要写这一过程。之所以仅取大王、文王二人，主要是因为他们确实是岐山九世周主最杰出的代表。灭商虽然完成于周武王，但周文王之时已显示出周将代商的必然趋势，商纣王囚周文王于羑里，只能延缓而无法阻遏这一历史发展。岐山圣地经营到周文王之世，已为周武王积蓄了足以灭商的雄厚实力，包括姜尚这样足以辅成伟业的贤臣。“有夷之行”，分明是先王开创的一条通向胜利之路。\n这首短诗，多人对其中个别字眼有不同的解读。如“彼作矣”的“彼”，有人解为百姓，那么“彼作矣”就是百姓们造起房屋；有人解为先祖大王，“彼作矣”就是先祖大王开创伟业。如“康”，一解为安定，安康；一解为赓，继承，继往开来之意。此所谓诗无达诂，见仁见智也。\n《周颂·天作》一诗将对圣地、圣人的歌颂融为一体，着力描写积蓄力量的进程，揭示历史发展的必然趋势，其文笔犹如大河滔滔，飞流直泻，既显庄严，又富气势。短短七句，有如此艺术效果，可见诗歌作者的大手笔。\n现代译文：上天造就岐山高，大王开始来开荒。百姓在此盖新房，文王让民享安康。民众奔往岐山旁，岐山大道坦荡荡。子孙永保这地方。\n⑴作：生，造就。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1783","poet":"先秦
