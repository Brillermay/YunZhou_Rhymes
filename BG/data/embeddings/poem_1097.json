战争 生活 长诗\n创作背景：西周初年，“三监”叛乱，殷商后裔武庚联合东方旧属国奄（今山东曲阜）、蒲姑（今山东博兴）及徐夷、淮夷起兵反周。周公东征，经过三年战争，诛武庚，黜“三监”，攻灭奄等十七国。继而，迁殷顽，封建姬姓大国（鲁、齐、卫、燕）监视东方各小国，实行分区经营。距镐京较近各小国统称小东，较远的各小国统称大东。为加强控制，从镐京到东方各国修筑一条战略公路，据《逸周书》：“辟开修道，五里有郊，十里有井，二十里有舍。”即所谓“周道”。或称“周行”，从西方向东方运输军队和军用物资，运回西方贡赋和征敛的财富。对东方各小国来说，这如同一条吸血管。西周统治者通过这条“周道”给被征服的东方人民带来压榨、劳役和困苦，于是产生怨愤和沉痛的叹息。\n《毛诗序》曰：“《大东》，刺乱也。东国困于役而伤于财，谭大夫作是诗以告病。”历代传笺疏注说解，基本上没有大的出入，肯定这是被征服的东方诸侯国臣民怨刺周王朝统治的诗歌作品。\n《毛诗序》说明作者是谭国大夫，而姓氏、经历和生活年代无从稽考。谭国在今山东济南市东南，对照《鲁颂》“遂荒大东”，那一带地区当属大东。从诗义看，他是东方旧国的大夫，因诗中的思想和情绪，绝对不可能产生于姬姓各大封国的当权派。他对“西人”的对立情绪，正反映了征服者的周王朝与被征服的东方旧国统治阶级的矛盾；他的地位下降，使他发出同情人民的不平之鸣，从而也反映了西周统治阶级与被征服国人民的矛盾。有人说这是一首民歌，这个论断是不对的，这是士大夫创作的用雅乐演唱的歌诗，不是用土乐演唱的民歌。\n这首诗写作的时间，据《左传·庄公十年》所记“齐师灭谭”，即在公元前684年齐国因为谭国对它“失礼”而出兵灭亡这个小国，时在东周初期，它只能写在谭国灭亡之前。诗的历史背景还是周王朝统治力量强大的时候，东周时王室已经衰微。姚际恒《诗经通论》说西周最后一代“幽王之时，号令犹行于诸侯，故东国诸侯之民愁怨如此。若东迁之后，则不能尔矣”。姚氏以为最迟当在幽王时代，这已难考证，只能确定创作在西周时代。\n文学赏析：这是一篇长诗。全诗结构严密，层次清晰，前后呼应。通篇运用对比和暗喻，由现实的人间，而虚幻的星空，展开东方人民遭受沉痛压榨的困苦图景和诗人忧愤抗争的激情。思路递进而奇崛，意蕴丰富而深厚。\n首章写“食”。由“有饛簋飧”联想到与如砥如矢的周道的关系。从“君子”和“小人”的不同境遇，抒写了诗人的悲伤。\n二章写“衣”。姚际恒《诗经通论》曰：“杼柚其空，惟此一语实写正旨。”织布机上的布帛全被征敛一空，寒霜上小民穿着破草鞋，而公子们还在经过那吸血管似的周道来榨取。这样的揭露相当深刻。\n三章写劳役。以薪柴为喻，通过烧柴不能水浸，隐喻疲病的人民应该休养生息。严粲《诗缉》解曰：“获薪以供爨，必曝而干之，然后可用，若浸之寒冽之泉，则湿腐而不可爨矣；喻民当抚恤之，然后可用，若困之以暴虐之政，则劳悴而不能胜矣。”\n四章写待遇不公平。“东人之子，职劳不来”，而“西人之子，粲粲衣服”；连周人中身份低贱的也“熊罴是裘”，家奴的子弟都“百僚是试”。通过这样典型的形象对照，反映了西周统治者与被征服的东方人民不平等的社会经济政治地位的悬殊。\n五章是全诗前后的过渡，前半继续写不公平的社会现象，郑笺云：“佩之鞙鞙然，居其官职，非其才之长也。徒美其佩而无其德，刺其素餐。”下半就自然地把视野转向上天，姚际恒《诗经通论》曰：“维天有汉，监亦有光。此二句不必有义。盖是时方中夜，仰天感叹，适见天河烂然有光，即所见以抒写其悲哀也。”下面两句也是仰天所视有感，“跂其织女，终日七襄”，正是呼应二章的“杼柚其空”，并引出下章的“不成报章”。这一章承前启后，过渡自然。\n六章面向灿灿星空驰骋想像。诗人怨织女织不成布帛，怨牵牛不能拉车运输，朝启明，夕长庚，有名无实，讥笑毕星在大路上张网，徒劳无功。整个运转的天体都不能为小民解决困苦。\n七章对星座的意象描写更深一层。王先谦《诗三家义集疏》分析道：“下四句与上四句虽同言箕斗，自分两义。上刺虚位，下刺敛民也。”簸箕星不能簸米扬糠，南斗星不能舀酒浆，都是徒具虚名，而且簸箕星张开大口，吐着长舌，斗星由西举柄向东。如欧...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1097","poet":"先秦
