王勃\n正文：城阙辅三秦，风烟望五津。\n与君离别意，同是宦游人。\n海内存知己，天涯若比邻。\n无为在歧路，儿女共沾巾。\n分类：唐诗三百首 初中古诗 友情 送别 哲理\n创作背景：《送杜少府之任蜀州》是他在长安的时候写的。“少府”，是唐朝对县尉的通称。这位姓杜的少府将到四川去上任，王勃在长安相送，临别时赠送给他这首送别诗。\n文学赏析：首联属“工对”中的“地名对”，极壮阔，极精整。第一句写长安的城垣、宫阙被辽阔的三秦之地所“辅”（护持、拱卫），气势雄伟，点送别之地。第二句里的“五津”指岷江的五大渡口白华津、万里津、江首津、涉头津、江南津，泛指“蜀川”，点杜少府即将宦游之地；而“风烟”、“望”，又把相隔千里的秦、蜀两地连在一起。自长安遥望蜀川，视线为迷蒙的风烟所遮，微露伤别之意，已摄下文“离别”、“天涯”之魂。\n因首联已对仗工稳，为了避免板滞，故次联以散调承之，文情跌宕。“与君离别意”承首联写惜别之感，欲吐还吞。翻译一下，那就是：“跟你离别的意绪啊！……”那意绪怎么样，没有说；立刻改口，来了个转折，用“同是宦游人”一句加以宽解。意思是：我和你同样远离故土，宦游他乡；这次离别，只不过是客中之别，又何必感伤！\n三联推开一步，奇峰突起。从构思方面看，很可能受了曹植《赠白马王彪》“丈夫志四海，万里犹比邻；恩爱苟不亏，在远分日亲”的启发。但高度概括，自铸伟词，便成千古名句。\n尾联紧接三联，以劝慰杜少府作结。“在歧路”，点出题面上的那个“送”字。歧路者，岔路也，古人送行，常至大路分岔处分手，所以往往把临别称为“临歧”。作者在临别时劝慰杜少府说：只要彼此了解，心心相连，那么即使一在天涯，一在海角，远隔千山万水，而情感交流，不就是如比邻一样近吗？可不要在临别之时哭鼻子、抹眼泪，象一般小儿女那样。\n作品点评：南朝的著名文学家江淹在《别赋》里写了各种各样的离别，都不免使人“黯然消魂”。古代的许多送别诗，也大都表现了“黯然消魂”的情感。王勃的这一首，却一洗悲酸之态，意境开阔，音调爽朗，独标高格。是初唐四杰之一的王勃在京城长安送别一位姓杜的朋友到蜀地任县令时所作的抒情诗。朋友即将上任，诗人劝慰他不要为远别而悲伤：虽然远隔天涯，但友谊不会因为距离的遥远而淡薄，他们的心是连在一起的。虽为送别诗，但全诗却无伤感之情，诗人的胸襟开朗，语句豪放清新，委婉亲切，表现了友人间真挚深厚的友情。\n全诗结构严谨，起承转合章法井然，用朴素的语言直抒胸臆，具有很高的艺术造诣。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴少府：官名。之：到、往。蜀州：今四川崇州。\n⑵城阙（què ）辅三秦：城阙，即城楼，指唐代京师长安城。辅，护卫。三秦，指长安城附近的关中之地，即今陕西省潼关以西一带。秦朝末年，项羽破秦，把关中分为三区，分别封给三个秦国的降将，所以称三秦。这句是倒装句，意思是京师长安三秦作保护。五津：指岷江的五个渡口白华津、万里津、江首津、涉头津、江南津。这里泛指蜀川。辅三秦：一作“俯西秦”。\n⑶风烟望五津：“风烟”两字名词用作状语，表示行为的处所。全句意为江边因远望而显得迷茫如啼眼，是说在风烟迷茫之中，遥望蜀州。\n⑷君：对人的尊称，相当于“您”。\n⑸同：一作“俱”。宦（huàn）游：出外做官。\n⑹海内：四海之内，即全国各地。古代人认为我国疆土四周环海，所以称天下为四海之内。\n⑺天涯：天边，这里比喻极远的地方。比邻：并邻，近邻。\n⑻无为：无须、不必。歧（qí）路：岔路。古人送行常在大路分岔处告别。\n⑼沾巾：泪水沾湿衣服和腰带。意思是挥泪告别。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2180","poet":"唐代
