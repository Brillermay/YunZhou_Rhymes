咏史怀古 赞颂\n文学赏析：这首颂诗先写西周为天命所归及古公亶父（太王）经营岐山、打退昆夷的情况，再写王季的继续发展和他的德行，最后重点描述了文王伐密、灭崇的事迹和武功。这些事件，是周部族得以发展、得以灭商建国的重大事件，太王、王季、文王，都是周王朝的“开国元勋”，对周部族的发展和周王朝的建立，作出了卓越的贡献，所以作者极力地赞美他们，歌颂他们，字里行间充溢着深厚的爱部族、爱祖先的思想感情。全诗八章，有四章叙写了文王，说明是以文王的功业为重点的。\n全诗八章，章十二句。内容丰富，气魄宏大。前四章重点写太王，后四章写文王，俨然是一部周部族的周原创业史。\n首章先从周太王得天眷顾、迁岐立国写起。周人原先是一个游牧民族，居于今陕西、甘肃接境一带。传说从后稷开始，做了帝尧的农师，始以农桑为业，并初步建国，以邰（今陕西武功一带）为都（见《大雅·生民》）。到了第四代公刘之时，又举族迁往豳（邠）地（今陕西旬邑一带），行地宜，务耕种。开荒定居，部族更加兴旺和发展（见《大雅·公刘》）。第十三代（依《史记·周本纪》）为古公亶父（即周太王），因受戎狄之侵、昆夷之扰，又迁居于岐山下之周原（今陕西岐山一带），开荒垦田，营建宫室，修造城郭，革除戎俗，发展农业，使周部族日益强大（见《大雅·緜》）。此章说是天命所使，当然是夸张的说法。但尊天和尊祖的契合，正是周人“君权神授”思想的表现。\n第二章具体描述了太王在周原开辟与经营的情景。连用四组排比语句，选用八个动词，罗列了八种植物，极其生动形象地表现太王创业的艰辛和气魄的豪迈。最后还点明：太王赶走了昆夷，娶了佳偶（指太姜），使国家更加强大。\n第三章又写太王立业，王季继承，既合天命，又扩大了周部族的福祉，并进一步奄有四方。其中，特别强调“帝作封作对，自大伯王季”。太王有三子：太伯、虞仲和季历（即王季）。太王爱季历，太伯、虞仲相让，因此王季的继立，是应天命、顺父心、友兄弟的表现。写太伯是虚，写王季是实。但“夹写太伯，从王季一面写友爱，而太伯之德自见”（方玉润《诗经原始》），既是夹叙法，亦是推原法，作者的艺术用心，是值得深入体味的。\n第四章集中描述了王季的德音。说他“克明克类，克长克君；王比大邦，克顺克比”，充分表现了他的圣明睿智，为王至宜。其中，用“帝度其心，貊其德音”，以突出其尊贵的地位和煊赫的名声；而“比于文王，其德靡悔”，既说明了王季的德泽流长，又为以下各章写文王而做了自然的过渡。\n《皇矣》在《大雅·文王之什》，当然重点是在歌颂和赞美文王。因而此诗从第五章起，就集中描述文王的功业了。\n第五章先写上帝对文王的教导：“无然畔援，无然歆羡，诞先登于岸。”即要文王勇往直前，面对现实，先占据有利的形势。虽不言密人侵入和文王怎么去做，但其紧张的气氛已充分显示了出来。接着作者指出“密人不恭，敢距大邦”，一场激烈的战争势在难免了。密人“侵阮阻共”，意欲侵略周国，文王当机立断，“爰整其旅，以按徂旅”，并强调，这是“笃于周祜”、“对于天下”的正义行动。\n第六章写双方的战斗形势进一步发展。密人“侵自阮疆，陟我高冈”，已经进入境内了。文王对密人发出了严重的警告，并在“岐之阳”、“渭之将”安扎营寨，严正对敌。写出情况十分严峻，使读者如临其境。\n第七章写战前的情景，主要是上帝对文王的教导，要他“不大声以色，不长夏以革”，就是不要疾言厉色，而要从容镇定；不要光凭武器硬拼，而要注意策略。要“顺帝之则”、“询尔仇方，同尔兄弟”，即按照上帝意志，联合起同盟和兄弟之国，然后再“以尔钩援，与尔临冲”，去进攻崇国的城池。崇国当时也是周国的强敌，上言密，此言崇...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1461","poet":"先秦
