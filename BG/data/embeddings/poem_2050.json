佚名\n正文：绥万邦，屡丰年。\n天命匪解，桓桓武王。\n保有厥士，于以四方，克定厥家。\n于昭于天，皇以间之。\n分类：诗经 祷词\n创作背景：近现代学者一般认为《周颂·桓》是《大武》中的一个乐章的歌辞。《大武》原作于武王伐纣成功告庙之时，当时只有三成。《逸周书·世俘》中也有记载，武王班师回镐京之四月辛亥，“荐俘、殷王鼎，武王乃翼，矢珪矢宪，告天宗上帝。”第四天，“甲寅，谒（告）我（伐）殷于牧野，王佩赤白旂，籥人奏《武》，王入进《万》，献《明明》三终。”故王国维《说勺舞象舞》一文推测，《大武》之六成是原先的三成和《三象》合并的，这六成可以分开来表演，还可以独立表演，于是名称也就随之而不同。这一推测大约是正确的。\n据《礼记·乐记》，孔子对《大武》六成所表现的历史事件作有如下说明：“始而北出；再成而灭商；三成而南；四成而南国是疆；五成而分，周公左，召公右；六成复缀，以崇天子（按，旧读“崇”下断句，非）。”郑玄注解“六成”为“六奏象兵还振旅也”。而《毛诗序》云：“《桓》，讲武类祃也。桓，武志也。”孔颖达疏云：“《桓》诗者，讲武类祃之乐歌也，武王将欲伐殷，陈列六军，讲习武事，又为类祭于上帝，为祃祭于所征之地，治兵祭神，然后克纣，至周公、成王大平之时，诗人追述其事，而为此歌焉。”则所述与《礼记》所引孔子之言不合。按谥法辟土服远曰桓，此篇文字又有“于以四方，克定厥家”之句，表明周王朝已经统有四方，则毛序孔疏谓此诗为武王伐殷讲武类祃之乐歌与原诗文本不合。今按：《大武》六成的乐舞表现的是周公带成王东伐奄国之后，回到镐京，大会四方诸侯及远国使者，举行阅兵仪式，即所谓“兵还振旅”，以扬天子之威的史实，《周颂·桓》诗即为举行阅兵仪式前的祷词。\n文学赏析：据《左传·宣公十二年》“楚子曰：‘武王克商，作《颂》曰：……又作《武》，……其六曰：‘绥万邦，屡丰年。”’可知《桓》是乐舞《大武》六成（第六场）的歌诗（关于《大武》的详细介绍，见《周颂·我将》一诗的鉴赏文字）。据《礼记·乐记》，孔子对《大武》六成所表现的历史事件作有如下说明：“始而北出；再成而灭商；三成而南；四成而南国是疆；五成而分，周公左，召公右；六成复缀，以崇天子（按，旧读“崇”下断句，非）。”郑玄注解“六成”为“六奏象兵还振旅也”。而《毛诗序》云：“《桓》，讲武类祃也。桓，武志也。”孔颖达疏云：“《桓》诗者，讲武类祃之乐歌也，武王将欲伐殷，陈列六军，讲习武事，又为类祭于上帝，为祃祭于所征之地，治兵祭神，然后克纣，至周公、成王大平之时，诗人追述其事，而为此歌焉。”则所述与《礼记》所引孔子之言不合。按谥法辟土服远曰桓，此篇文字又有“于以四方，克定厥家”之句，表明周王朝已经统有四方，则毛序孔疏谓此诗为武王伐殷讲武类祃之乐歌与原诗文本不合。今按：《大武》六成的乐舞表现的是周公带成王东伐奄国之后，回到镐京，大会四方诸侯及远国使者，举行阅兵仪式，即所谓“兵还振旅”，以扬天子之威的史实，《桓》诗即为举行阅兵仪式前的祷词。\n诗的前三句，是以“绥万邦，娄丰年”来证明天命是完全支持周朝的。“娄丰年”在农耕社会对赢得民心起着举足轻重的作用，百姓对能致物阜年丰的王朝总会表示拥护；而获得农业丰收，在上古时代离不开风调雨顺的自然条件，“娄丰年”便理所当然地成为天意的象征。中间四句歌颂英勇的武王和全体将士，并告诉全体诸侯，武王的将士有能力征服天下、保卫周室。叠字词“桓桓”领出整段文字，有威武雄壮的气势，而“于以四方”云云，与首句“绥万邦”上下绾合，一强调国泰民安，一强调征服统治，而都有周室君临天下的自豪感。最后两句是祷告上苍、让天帝来作证，以加强肯定，同时也是对第三句“天命匪解”的呼应。诗的核心就是扬军威以震慑诸侯，从而达到树立周天子崇高权威的目的，其内容正与《尚书·周书·多方》一致。诗名为《桓》，“桓”即威武之貌，正点明了主题。诗的语言雍容典雅，威严而出之以和平，呈现出一种欢乐的氛围，涌动着新王朝的蓬勃朝气。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2050","poet":"先秦
