卢照邻\n正文：将军出紫塞，冒顿在乌贪。\n笳喧雁门北，阵翼龙城南。\n雕弓夜宛转，铁骑晓参驔。\n应须驻白日，为待战方酣。\n分类：乐府 爱国 战争\n文学赏析：这是一首拟古诗，通过描写汉初与匈奴的边境战争，歌颂了当时边防将士浴血奋战，保卫疆土的功绩，反映了唐初对外战争的某些现实。[10]\n诗的首联是严整的对句。“将军出紫塞，冒顿在乌贪”指出交战的双方，又介绍交战的地理背景。能征善战的单于冒顿，杀父自立，灭东胡，逐月支，征服丁零，侵入秦之河南（今内蒙古河套一带）地，势力强盛。西汉初年，不时进一步南下侵扰，严重影响西汉王朝。这里以“冒顿”对“将军”，冒顿既已如此勇猛，那么“将军”自然也是身手不凡的。这里为下文的酣战作铺垫。“乌贪”与“紫塞”相对，说明是在异域的。“紫塞”是古代人们对长城的习惯称谓。紫色，象征着高贵、庄严，不可侵犯，正与乌相对。“乌”字后再加以“贪”字，更易使人产生鄙薄感。诗歌利用字词的形、义及色彩在人们心中的定势，巧妙地造成一种邪不压正的气势，既为下文作铺垫，又表现必胜的信心。\n“笳喧雁门北，阵翼龙城南”，照应首句，指出“将军出紫塞”的原因。敌人如此猖狂，汉军自然要奋起抗敌。下句的“阵翼龙城南”也因此有了着落。不但正面迎击，还左右包围，两翼的战阵已达“龙城南”——直捣敌巢。足见汉军之强大，英勇抗击外敌的浩然正气充斥字里行间。\n“雕弓夜宛转，铁骑晓参驔”，进一步描写抗敌将士的战斗生活。他们严阵以待夜不释弓，晨不离鞍，随时准备飞矢跃马，追奔逐北。比起“枕戈待旦”，“夜抱玉鞍”这样的描写新颖而有气魄。“宛转”“参驔”，既恰当地表现了前方将士紧张而又镇定自若的心情，又充满了必胜的信心。\n“应须驻白日，为待战方酣”是流传千古的名句。诗里虽没具体说明这次交锋是什么时候开始的，但白日即将结束，战斗还在激烈地进行。将士们等待迎接决战的胜利，因此从心底发出了呼唤：“太阳呀！请您留下来，让我们与敌军决一雌雄！”日出日落是不可改变的自然规律，“应须驻白日”的呼唤，表面悖理而近痴，实则生动地表现了将士们高昂的斗志。这是由“安得长绳系白日”诗句变化来的。结尾以“战方酣”三字，并未直说战争的胜负，但孰胜孰负已然明了，因为第二联已表明直捣敌巢——阵翼龙城南了。总体来说，这是一首裁乐府以入律的佳作。\n现代译文：将军骑马出了紫塞长城，去与驻扎在乌贪的冒顿作战。\n\n1、战城南：汉乐府《铙歌》名，内容描写战争的伤亡景象。后人以此题作诗，亦多写战争。\n2、紫塞：泛言边塞。崔豹《古今注》卷上：“秦筑长城，土色皆紫，汉塞亦然，故称紫塞焉。”\n3、冒顿（mò dú）：即冒顿单于，秦末汉初匈奴的首领，此泛指敌酋。乌贪：汉西域国名，乌贪訾离国之省称。《汉书·西域传》下：“乌贪訾离国，王治于娄谷。”其境在今新疆伊犁河流域。此借指敌人的根据地。\n4、笳喧：胡笳的弹奏声。笳：匈奴乐器，即胡笳。雁门：山名，亦关名，故址在今山西阳高县北，自古即为戍守重地。\n5、阵翼：战阵的两侧。龙城：此借指敌方的首府。\n6、雕弓：雕刻有花纹之弓，此代指携带雕弓的士兵。宛转：犹蜿蜒，队列行进曲折延伸的样子。\n7、铁骑：披挂铁甲的精锐骑兵。驿：马脚胫参有长毫之称。参驔：检查马匹铠甲等。参，检验。对于该词组读音有两种看法，一说“cāndiàn”，另说“cāntán”。\n8、驻白日：用鲁阳挥戈退日典故。鲁阳，战国时楚之县公，传说他曾挥戈使太阳退回。《淮南子·览冥训》：“鲁阳公与韩构难，战酣，日暮，援弓而挥之，日为之退三舍。”（一舍等于三十里）于是二人继续战斗。\n9、为待：为的是等待，战方酣：战斗正激烈。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1432","poet":"唐代
