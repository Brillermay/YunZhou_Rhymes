李白\n正文：登高丘，望远海。\n六鳌骨已霜，三山流安在？\n扶桑半摧折，白日沈光彩。\n银台金阙如梦中，秦皇汉武空相待。\n精卫费木石，鼋鼍无所凭。\n君不见骊山茂陵尽灰灭，牧羊之子来攀登。\n盗贼劫宝玉，精灵竟何能？\n穷兵黩武今如此，鼎湖飞龙安可乘？\n分类：乐府 登高 联想\n文学赏析：此诗有托古讽今之意，名托刺秦始皇、汉武帝迷信求仙、穷兵黩武，实讽唐玄宗，具有深刻的社会意义。全诗可分为三部分。\n首二短句为第一段，点明登高山望远海。登高临海，极目远眺，诗人心潮澎湃，但他并没有写沧海扬波，洪涛排空的景象，而去写与大海、高山相关联的神话传说。\n中间八句为第二段，写望中想到传说中的神仙境界并不存在，神话传说也为虚妄。六鳌成枯骨，三山已经是过眼云烟。扶桑摧折，太阳的光彩已沉没殆尽。“银台金阙”犹如梦中烟云，秦皇汉武寻求的长生药亦如幻影。精卫填海，徒劳无功；鼋鼍为梁，不足为凭。\n末六句为第三段。写望中想到秦始皇、汉武帝穷兵黩武，妄想长生，终归一死。这一段为全诗之主旨所在。秦始皇骊山构陵，汉武帝茂陵筑墓，均已倾废荒芜。到而今，当年的英豪雄强早已灰飞烟灭，风光不再，只有听凭牧羊子赶着羊群来登临践踏。他们的魂灵守不住他们的墓冢，他们的余威阻止不了盗墓者贪婪的掘夺。昔日穷兵黩武，威加四方，何等霸气。如今仍落得个如此下场，要想乘飞龙而成仙，那简直就是白日做梦。历史就是无情的，自然也是残酷的。那些想超越自然法则的“野心家”们，终究如凡夫俗子一样，化作灰，堕为尘，成为深埋土堆里的一把枯骨，与庶民百姓没有两样。而他们那些愚妄的做法，最终成为后人的笑柄。诗意还不仅限于此。怀古仅仅是引领诗兴，由之写来，直奔主题。唐玄宗，溺于佛道，好神仙，求长生，比起秦皇汉武来，犹过之而无不及；其穷兵黩武之举，荒淫误国之行，与之相比，并无二致。借古鉴今，借古喻今，借古讽今，才是这首诗真正的主旨。\n这首诗主要不是怀古之作，而是感时之作。登高山，望远海，面对着绝好的写诗环境，绝好的诗歌材料，诗人却遥遥想起了历史上两位雄才大略的皇帝的求仙的荒诞，予以严厉抨击。这是对此类皇帝的讽刺和批判，也是对当朝皇帝的暗示。感时伤世，抨今讽今，说明诗人虽落泊漂零，仍然心系朝廷，心系国运。\n此诗典故密集，一个典故代表一种意象。这些意象的有序排列，组成了全诗的思维结构。\n现代译文：翻译\n\n注释\n⑴登高丘而望远：古辞无闻，可能是李白自创新辞。《乐府诗集》卷二十七列于《相和歌辞》。王琦注云：“此题旧无传闻。郭茂倩《乐府诗集》编是诗于相和曲中魏文帝‘登山而远望’一篇之后，疑太白拟此也，然文意却不顺。”\n⑵“六鳌”二句：六鳌三山的故事在《列子·汤问》中，是夏革讲给汤听的。革曰“渤海之东，不知几千亿万里，有大壑焉。其中有五山焉。一曰岱舆，二曰员峤，三曰方壶，四曰瀛洲，五曰蓬莱。五山之根无所连著，常随波上下往还，不得暂峙焉。仙圣毒之，诉之于帝。帝恐流于西极，失群圣之居，乃命禺强使巨鳌十五而戴之，迭为三番，六万岁一交焉，五山始峙。而龙伯之国有大人，举足不盈数步，而及五山之所。一钓而连六鳌，合负而趣归其国，灼其骨以数。于是岱舆、员峤二山流于北极，沉于大海，仙圣播迁者巨亿计。”\n⑶扶桑：传说中的神木，长在日出的地方。\n⑷“银台”二句：《史记·封禅书》：（齐）威、（齐）宣、燕昭使人入海求蓬莱、方丈、瀛洲。此三神山者，其传在渤海中，去人不远。患且至则船风引而去。盖尝至者，仙人及不死之药在焉。其物禽兽尽白，而黄金为宫阙。未至，望之如云。及到，三神山反居水下。临之，风辄引去，终莫能去云。及至秦始皇并天下，至海上，则方士言之不可胜数。始皇以为至海上而恐不及矣。使人乃赍童男女入海求之。船交海中，皆以风为解，曰未能至望见之焉。”《封禅书》又记：“今天子（汉武帝）初即位，尤敬鬼神之祀。遣方士入海中求蓬莱安期生之属。”\n⑸“精卫”句：谓“精卫填海”的故事不真实。《山海经·北山经》：发鸠之山有鸟焉，其状如乌，文首、白喙、赤足，名曰精卫。是炎帝之少女，名曰女娃。女娃于东海溺而不反，故为精卫。常衔西山之木以堙于东海。\n⑹“鼋鼍”句：言三神山既不存在，鼋鼍一类的神物也就无处寄身。仍言神物为虚幻。\n⑺“君不见”二句：谓求神仙、寻找不死药的秦皇、汉武仍不免一死，至今其人已化为尘土，陵寝荒废。秦始皇死葬骊山，汉武帝死葬茂陵。《汉书·楚元王传》：秦始皇帝葬于骊山之阿，下锢三泉，上崇山坟，其高五十余丈，周回五里有余。石椁为游馆，人膏为灯烛，水银为江海，黄金为凫雁。珍宝之臧，机械之变，棺椁之丽，宫馆之盛，不可胜原。又多杀宫人，生埋工匠，计以万数。天下苦其役而反之，骊山之作未成，而周章百万之师至其下矣。项羽燔其宫室营宇，往者咸见发掘。其后牧儿亡羊，羊入其凿，牧者持火照其羊，失火烧其臧椁。\n⑻“盗贼”句：盗贼是作者沿用统治者对农民起义军的称呼。据《晋书·索靖传》记载，赤眉起义军曾取走汉武帝陵园中的一部分金银财宝。\n⑼精灵：指秦...","metadata":{"poem_id":"245","poet":"唐代
