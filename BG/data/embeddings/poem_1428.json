佚名\n正文：芃芃棫朴，薪之槱之。\n济济辟王，左右趣之。\n济济辟王，左右奉璋。\n奉璋峨峨，髦士攸宜。\n淠彼泾舟，烝徒楫之。\n周王于迈，六师及之。\n倬彼云汉，为章于天。\n周王寿考，遐不作人？追琢其章，金玉其相。\n勉勉我王，纲纪四方。\n分类：诗经 赞美\n文学赏析：关于此诗的主旨，历代学者看法很不一致，主要有两种意见。《毛诗序》云：“文王能官人也。”“官人”语出《尚书·皋陶谟》：“知人则哲，能官人。”意谓善于选取人才并授以适当官职。而姚际恒《诗经通论》则曰：“此言文王能作士也。小序谓‘文王能官人’，差些，盖袭《左传》释《卷耳》之说。”“作士”一语直接取自此诗的“遐不作人”。孔颖达疏：“作人者，变旧造新之辞。”朱熹《诗集传》：“作人，谓变化鼓舞之也。”概而言之，即为培育造就人才及鼓舞振作人心。其实这两种意见并无大异，小序着眼的是前三章，故得出“官人”的结论，姚氏着眼的是后二章，故得出“作士”的结论。“官人”也罢，“作士”也罢，都离不开周王的盛德。\n全诗五章，每章四句。除第二章外，其余四章均以兴为发端，这在《大雅》中是罕见的。\n首章以“棫朴”起兴。毛传释曰：“山木茂盛，万民得而薪之；贤人众多，国家得用蕃兴。”此是将棫朴喻贤人。而《诗集传》释曰：“芃芃棫朴，则薪之槱之矣；济济辟王，则左右趣之矣。”意为灌木茂盛，则为人所乐用，君王美好，则为人所乐从。此是将棫朴喻君王。毛传释兴，每每孤立地就兴论兴，所以兴与下文的关系往往显得牵强附会。朱熹释兴，总是将起兴句与被兴句有机地联系起来，符合其“先言他物以引起所咏之词”的兴的定义。就此章而言，朱熹的解释似更为合理。\n首章是总述，总述周王有德，众士所归。而士分文、武，故二、三篇又分而述之，以补足深化首章之意。\n二章四句皆为赋。前两句“济济辟王，左右奉璋”承上两句“济济辟王，左右趣之”而来，而又启出下两句：“奉璋峨峨，髦士攸宜。”“璋”有二解，一为“牙璋”，发兵所用；一为“璋瓒”，祭祀所用。马瑞辰《毛诗传笺通释》云：“此诗下章言六师及之，则上言奉璋，当是发兵之事。故传惟言半圭曰璋，不以为祭祀所用之璋瓒耳。”据此，此章则与下章一样，均与武士有关。但马瑞辰注意了下章的“六师”而疏忽了此章的“髦士”。“髦士”在《诗经）中凡二见，另一为《小雅·甫田》中的“攸介攸止，烝我髦士”。《甫田》的髦士肯定为文士（多以为是田畯，即农官），故此诗恐亦不例外。所以璋还是训“璋瓒”为好。\n三章以“泾舟”起兴。朱熹《诗集传》以为舟中之人自觉划动船桨实喻六师之众自觉跟随周王出征，云：“言‘淠彼泾舟’，则舟中之人无不楫之。‘周王于迈’，则六师之众追而及之。盖众归其德，不令而从也。”方玉润《诗经原始》亦云：“文王征伐，六师扈从，有似烝徒楫舟，则其作武勇之士也又可见。”齐诗根据此章末两句“周王于迈，六师及之”而断定此诗是言文王伐崇之事，后人多有从之者。其实以诗证史可信，以史证诗难信，况且把诗中所言一一坐实并无多大意义，所以还是把此章看作泛言为好。\n如果说前三章是以众望所归来烘托周王的话，那么后两章则转为直接的歌颂了。\n四章以“云汉”起兴。郑笺曰：“云汉之在天，其为文章，譬犹天子为法度于天下。”诸家多认为“云汉”乃喻周王。末句“遐不作人（何不培养人）”虽是问句，实则是肯定周王能培育人。严粲《诗缉》云：“董氏曰：‘遐不作人，甚言其作也。”’类似的用法还见于《小雅·南山有台》“乐只君子，遐不眉寿”、“乐只君子，遐不黄耇”。\n末章的兴义较难理解。朱熹在《诗集传》中曰：“追之琢之，则所以美其文者至矣。金之玉之，则所以美其质者至矣。勉勉我王，则所以纲纪乎四方者至矣。”他还在《诗传遗说》中补充道：“功夫细密处，又在此一章，如曰‘勉勉我王，纲纪四方’，四方都便在他线索内牵著都动。”他答人问“勉勉即是纯一不已否？”又曰：“然。如‘追琢其章，金玉其相’，是那工夫到后，文章真个是盛美，资质真个是坚实。”二者合而言之，也就是说：精雕细刻到极致，是最美的外表，纯金碧玉到极致，是最好的质地，周王勤勉至极，有如雕琢的文彩和金玉的质地，是天下最好的管理者。如此释诗，似太迂曲，所以很多人并不把前两句视作兴，他们认为，“追琢其章”“金玉其相”的“其”指的就是周王，意谓周王既有美好的装饰，又有优秀的内质，而又勤勉不已，所以能治理好四方。\n现代译文：棫树朴树多茂盛，砍作木柴祭天神。周王气度美无伦，群臣簇拥左右跟。\n\n⑴芃（péng）芃：植物茂盛貌。棫（yù）朴：棫，白桵（ruǐ）；朴，枹（bāo）木，二者均为灌木名。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1428","poet":"先秦
