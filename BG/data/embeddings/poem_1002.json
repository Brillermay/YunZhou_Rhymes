山水 忧国忧民\n创作背景：《毛诗序》认为此诗作于周幽王时，郑玄认为作于周厉王时。阮元在《揅经室集》中对郑玄之说多有驳辨。据天文学家考订，此诗中记载的日食发生在周幽王六年夏历十月一日（公元前776年9月6日），这是世界上最早的日食记录。因此，此诗当作于周幽王六年（公元前776年）。\n此诗所讲述的那个自然灾害频发、王国日益不堪的状态，正是周幽王统治时期的弊政。在周王国面临着十分严重的天灾人祸这种情况下，出现了日月食。而这些自然现象又发生在周人的发祥地陕北地区。这个地区在周人心中有着特殊的感情。在其地所发生的自然现象，对于当时畏惧自然力量的人们而言是十分重视的。因此，这些自然现象对当时的社会就有了明显的警示意义。\n文学赏析：此诗犹如一首悲愤的乐曲。全诗八章，可分为三部分。\n第一部分（前三章），将日食、月食、强烈地震同朝廷用人不善联系起来，抒发自己深沉的悲痛与忧虑。诗人不理解日食、月食、地震发生的原因，认为它们是上天对人类的警告，所以开篇先说十月初一这天发生了日食。“日者，君象也”，夏末老百姓即以日喻君。日而无光，在古人是以为预示着有关君国的大灾殃。诗人将此事放在篇首叙出，使人震惊。第二章将国家政治颓败、所用非人同日食联系起来议论，第三章又连带叙出前不久发生的强烈地震。诗人关于这些极度反常的自然现象的描述，表现了他对于国家前途的无比担忧和恐惧。诗中写的地震有史实记载，《国语·周语》：“幽王二年，西周三川皆震。”“是岁三川竭，岐山崩。”诗中“百川沸腾，山冢崒崩；高岸为谷，深谷为陵”的具有特征性的大特写使两千多年后的人读起来，仍然感到惊心动魄。诗人的如椽巨笔为读者描绘了一幅历史上少有的巨大的灾变图。\n第二部分（中三章），回顾与揭露当今执政者的无数罪行。诗的第一部分节奏强烈，写出了诗人所见到的上天震怒的状况，在震惊与恐惧中又缠绕着诗人无限的忧伤。他不明白当今执政者为何不行善政制止天灾，这就很自然地过渡到诗的第二部分。这一部分开列了皇父诸党的清单，把他们钉在历史的耻辱柱上。这些人从里到外把持朝政，欺上瞒下。皇父卿士，不想怎样把国家治理好，而是强抓丁役，搜括民财，扰民害民，并且还把这种行为说成是合乎礼法的。他把聪明才智全用在维护自己和家族利益上；他看到国家岌岌可危，毫无悔罪之心，也没有一点责任感，自己远远迁于向邑，而且带去了许多贵族富豪，甚至不给周王留下一个有用的老臣。用这样的人当权，国家没有不亡之理。然而，是谁重用了这些人呢？诗人用“艳妻煽方处”一句含蓄地指出了居于幕后的周幽王。\n第三部分（后二章），写诗人在天灾人祸面前的立身态度。他虽然清醒地看到了周朝的严重危机，但他不逃身远害，仍然兢兢业业、尽职尽公。在忠直与邪恶两类臣子中，诗人是属于忠直的一类；在统治阶级内部斗争中，诗人又是属于失败的一类。所以，在一定程度上，诗人的命运同国家的命运是一致的。在诗中，诗人哀叹个人的不幸，哀叹政治的腐败、黑暗与不公，实际上也就是在哀叹着国家的命运。所以说，这一部分同前两部分是有联系的。诗人从三个角度有力地表现了忧国这个主题。\n此诗的语言基本上是直言抒写，喷涌而出，但有的地方也采用反语和冷峻的讽刺，如“艳妻煽方处”、“皇父孔圣”。有的语言表现力很强，如说皇父等人强霸百姓田产时，用“予不戕，礼则然矣”充分表现了他们的强词夺理、蛮横霸道。\n现代译文：正是十月的时候，初一这天是辛卯。天上日食忽发生，这是凶险的征兆。往日月蚀夜光微，今天日食天地黑。如今天下众黎民，大难将临令人悲。\n\n1.交：日月交会，指晦朔之间。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1002","poet":"先秦
