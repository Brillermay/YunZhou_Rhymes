王维\n正文：新丰美酒斗十千，咸阳游侠多少年。\n相逢意气为君饮，系马高楼垂柳边。\n出身仕汉羽林郎，初随骠骑战渔阳。\n孰知不向边庭苦，纵死犹闻侠骨香。\n一身能擘两雕弧，虏骑千重只似无。\n偏坐金鞍调白羽，纷纷射杀五单于。\n汉家君臣欢宴终，高议云台论战功。\n天子临轩赐侯印，将军佩出明光宫。\n分类：乐府 励志 少年 喝酒 边塞 战争\n文学赏析：这组诗的第一首，写侠少的欢聚痛饮。诗开头便以“美酒”领起，因为豪饮酣醉自来被认为是英雄本色，所谓“三杯吐然诺，五岳倒为轻。眼花耳热后，意气素霓生。”（李白《少年行》）饮酒在当时因能激发意气而被视作胜事。“斗十千”语出曹植《名都篇》：“归来宴平乐，美酒斗十千”，按李白也有《将进酒》诗云：“昔时陈王宴平乐，斗酒十千恣欢谑”，此诗意近李诗，不仅极言酒之珍美，而且还借前人的用语写出慷慨好客、纵情欢乐的盛况。盖游侠之饮原非独酌遣闷，其倜傥意气正在大会宾客之际才得以充分的表现。第二句言“咸阳游侠”，乃以京都侠少为其代表。游侠人物大多出身于都市的闾里市井之中，故司马迁在《史记·游侠列传》里径直称之为“闾里之侠”，咸阳为秦的国都，则京邑为游侠的渊薮也不言自明，这里不过是举其佼佼者以概全体。诗的前两句以“新丰美酒”烘染在前，“咸阳游侠”出场在后，而“多少年”则为全篇之纲。诗的后二句更进一层，写出侠少重友情厚交谊的作风。即便是邂逅相逢的陌路人，杯酒之间便能成为意气相倾的知己，所谓“论交从优孟，买醉入新丰”（李白《结客少年场行》）、“一生大笑能几回，斗酒相逢须醉倒”（岑参《凉州馆中与诸判官夜集》），正表现了他们同声相应的热情。因此，在他们开怀畅饮的豪爽风度中，还渗透着为朋友倾情倒意，肝胆相照的人情美。酒如一面镜子，映照出他们率真坦荡的人生态度。诗为人物写照，最后却宕开去以景语收束。诗人撇开楼里的场面，转而从楼外的景象落笔，其实写外景还是为内景服务的。末句中的“高楼”不仅和首句呼应，暗示了人物的豪纵气派，而且以其卓然挺立的雄姿一扫鄙陋猥琐之态；“系马垂柳”则以骏马和杨柳的意象，衬托出少年游侠富有青春气息的俊爽风致。有此一笔，使情景历历如绘，遂在表现人物豪宕气概的同时，又显得蕴藉有致。全诗用笔的跳荡灵动，也是和少年奔放不羁的性格神采相吻合的。\n第二首，写游侠的出征边塞。这首诗里所说的“仕汉”“骠骑”，以及下面两首诗里出现的“五单于”“汉家君臣”等，都是借汉事喻唐，这在唐诗中几乎是习闻熟见的惯例。这里说少年委身事君，入仕之初便担任了羽林郎的职务。由于羽林郎宿仗卫内、亲近帷幄，地位十分重要，故非一般等闲之辈可以入选。《后汉书·地理志》云：“汉兴，六郡良家子选给羽林。”由此即可见一斑。骠骑指武帝时的名将霍去病，曾多次统率大军反击匈奴侵扰，战功显赫。少年报国心切，一心想效功当世，一旦国家有事，便毫不犹豫地随军出征。边关是遥远荒寒的，沙场的搏杀更是出生入死，而主人公“明知山有虎，偏向虎山行”，这种为国献身的精神，和曹植的《白马篇》里“捐躯赴国难，视死忽如归”的少年英雄是一脉相承的。所不同的是，曹诗通篇是用第三人称的视角来加以客观的描述和赞颂，这里却借少年自己的口吻直抒胸臆：第三句以自诘的口气反挑，使文势陡起波澜，末句则以斩截之语收束，而“孰”“不”“纵”“犹”等虚词的连用，又在接二连三的转折中不断加强语气，活脱地传达出少年从容朱毅的神情和义无返顾的决心。这种借顿挫的用笔展示人物内心世界的手法，不仅很有力度，而且进一步深化了游侠“意气”的内涵。\n第三首，写少年的勇武杀敌。诗人将主人公置于孤危险恶的战争情势之中。“虏骑千重”指敌人大军压境，形成包围之势；“众敌酋倾巢出动，来势汹汹，企图以优势兵力取胜。而少年以“一身”对“千重”之敌，竟能左右驰突于敌阵之中，如入无人之境，且能擒贼先擒王，将凶蛮剽悍的敌酋“纷纷射杀”，其过人的胆略和武艺已分明可见。这里把少年写成孤胆英雄，意在突出他的勇冠三军、战功卓著。诗的一、三两句，以特写镜头为少年英武矫健的身姿写照：“擘两雕弧”言其多力善射，能左右开弓；“偏坐金鞍”言其鞍马功夫娴熟，能在疾驰的马背上自如地变换各种姿势；“调白羽”则是善于在运动中瞄准目标，箭无虚发。二、四两句，从对方着笔来反衬少年的艺高胆大。敌我双方的力量愈是悬殊，也就愈能表现主人公无所畏惧的英雄气概，而这种气概，又正来自于其置生死于度外的献身精神。这样，这首诗就和上一首彼此呼应，并为下一首写功高不赏张本。诗中所出现的雕弧、金鞍和白羽，均是以着色之笔略加点染，本来是爱其人而及其物，这里的物又为人增色，人与物原不妨是互相辉映、相得益彰的。盛唐诗人每喜表现尚武精神，如李白自称“弯弓绿弦开，满月不惮坚。闲骑骏马猎，一射两虎穿。”（《赠宣城宇文太守兼呈崔侍御》）杜甫自述“射飞曾纵鞚，引臂落鹙鸧。”（《壮游》）王维则称赞他的一位族弟说：“读书复骑射，带剑游淮阴……席帆聊问罪，卉服尽成擒。”（《送从弟蕃游淮南...","metadata":{"poem_id":"698","poet":"唐代
