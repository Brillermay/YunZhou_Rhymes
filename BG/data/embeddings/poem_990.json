抒情 怨刺\n文学赏析：这首诗的抒情主人公具有政治远见，也有能力。故统治阶级当权者开始极表需要他（“彼求我则，如不我得”），但得到之后又不重用（“执我仇仇，亦不我力”）。他担忧国家的前途，同情广大人民的苦难遭遇，反而遭到小人的排挤和中伤（“忧心愈愈，是以有侮”）。他是一个忧国忧民而又不见容于世的孤独的士大夫知识分子形象。诗的抒情主人公面对霜降异时、谣言四起的现实，想到国家危在旦夕，百姓无辜受害，而自己又无力回天，一方面哀叹生不逢时（“父母生我，胡俾我瘉？不自我先，不自我后”），一方面对于一会儿这么说，一会儿那么说（“好言自口，莠言自口”），反覆无常、扰乱天下的当权者表示了极大的愤慨。他最终身心交瘁，积郁成疾（“癙忧以痒”）。诗中还表现了三种人的心态。第一种是末世昏君。此诗没有明确指出周幽王，而是用暗示的方法让人们想到幽王。“天”在古代常用来象征君王，诗中说“民今方殆，视天梦梦”，就是很严厉地指责周幽王面对百姓危殆、社稷不保的现实毫不觉悟，却只顾占卜解梦（“召彼故老，讯之占梦”）。“赫赫宗周，褒姒灭之”二句，矛头直指最高统治者。此诗批评最高当权者亲小人（“瞻彼中林，侯薪侯蒸”），远贤臣（“乃弃尔辅”），行虐政（“念国之为虐”）。指出如果国家真正颠覆，再求救于人，则悔之无及（“载输尔载，将伯助予”）。这样的末世昏君前有桀、纣，后有胡亥、杨广，历史上不绝如缕，所以其揭露是有意义的。第二种是得志的小人。他们巧言令色，嫉贤妒能（“好言自口，莠言自口”），结党营私，朋比为奸（“洽比其邻，昏姻孔云”），心肠毒如蛇蝎（“胡为虺蜴”），但却能得到君王的宠幸与重用，享有高官厚禄，诗人对这种蠹害国家的蟊贼表示了极大的憎恨与厌恶。第三种人是广大人民。他们承受着层层的剥削和压迫，在暴政之下没有平平安安的生活，而只有形形色色的灾难（“民今无禄，天天是椓”），而且动辄得咎，只能谨小慎微，忍气吞声（“不敢不局”、“不敢不蹐”）。诗人对广大人民寄予了深切的同情。“民之无辜，并其臣仆”，表现了无比的沉痛。昏君施行虐政，百姓是最直接的受害者，上天惩罚昏君，百姓也要无辜受过。此诗正道出了乱世人民的不幸。\n全诗四言中杂以五言，便于表现激烈的情感，又显得错落有致。全诗以诗人忧伤、孤独、愤懑的情绪为主线，首尾贯串，一气呵成，感情充沛。其中有很多形象的比喻，如以鱼在浅池终不免遭殃，喻乱世之人不论如何躲藏，也躲不过亡国之祸。还运用了对比手法，如诗的最后两章说，得势之人有酒有菜，有屋有禄，朋党往来，其乐融融；黎民百姓穷苦无依，备受天灾人祸之苦。“哿矣富人，哀此惸独”正像杜甫的“朱门酒肉臭，路有冻死骨”一样，表现了诗人的极大愤慨。\n现代译文：正月地上满是霜，让我心中很忧伤。民心已乱谣言起，谣言传播遍四方。独我一人愁当世，忧思不去萦绕长。可怜担惊又受怕，忧思成疾病难当。\n\n1.正（zhēng）月：正阳之月，夏历四月。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"990","poet":"先秦
