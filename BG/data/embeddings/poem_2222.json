王勃\n正文：长江悲已滞，万里念将归。\n况属高风晚，山山黄叶飞。\n分类：山水 思乡\n创作背景：这首诗创作于唐高宗咸亨二年（672），是王勃旅蜀后期时的作品。总章二年（669）王勃入蜀，在《入蜀纪行诗序》里他写道：“五月癸卯，余自长安观景物于蜀，遂出褒斜之隘道，抵岷峨之绝经。”在游《游山庙序》里也说：“吾之有生，二十载矣，雅厌城阙，酷嗜江海。”表面看他离开长安的态度似乎很洒脱，而内心是很复杂的。被逐出沛王府后，他无所事事，本想借着蜀地山水名胜以消解胸中的积愤。实际上，南国物候也为诗人增添了不少的乡思和烦忧。\n文学赏析：这是一首抒写旅愁归思的诗，大概作于王勃被废斥后在巴蜀作客期间。\n诗的前半首是一联对句。诗人以“万里”对“长江”，是从地理概念上写远在异乡、归路迢迢的处境；以“将归”对“已滞”，是从时间概念上写客旅久滞、思归未归的状况。两句中的“悲”和“念”二字，则是用来点出因上述境况而产生的感慨和意愿。诗的后半首，即景点染，用眼前“高风晚”、“黄叶飞”的深秋景色，进一步烘托出这个“悲”和“念”的心情。\n首句“长江悲已滞”，在字面上也许应解释为因长期滞留在长江边而悲叹。可以参证的有他的《羁游饯别》诗中的“游子倦江干”及《别人四首》之四中的“雾色笼江际”、“何为久留滞”诸句。但如果与下面“万里”句合看，可能诗人还想到长江万里、路途遥远而引起羁旅之悲。这首诗的题目是《山中》，也可能是诗人在山上望到长江而起兴，是以日夜滚滚东流的江水来对照自己长期滞留的旅况而产生悲思。与这句诗相似的有杜甫《成都府》诗中的名句“大江东流去，游子日月长”，以及谢脁的名句“大江流日夜，客心悲未央”。这里，“长江”与“已滞”以及“大江”与“游子”、“客心”的关系，诗人自己可以有各种联想，也任读者作各种联想。在一定范围内，理解可以因人而异，即所谓“诗无达诂”。\n次句“万里念将归”，似出自宋玉《九辩》“登山临水兮送将归”句，而《九辩》的“送将归”，至少有两种不同的解释：一为送别将归之人；一为送别将尽之岁。至于这句诗里的“将归”，如果从前面提到的《羁游饯别》、《别人四首》以及《王子安文集》中另外一些客中送别的诗看，可以采前一解释；如果从此诗后半首的内容看，也可以取后一解释。但联系此句中的“念”字，则以解释为思归之念较好，也就是说，这句的“将归”和上句的“已滞”一样，都指望远怀乡之人，即诗人自己。但另有一说，把上句的“已滞”看作在异乡的客子之“悲”，把这句的“将归”看作万里外的家人之“念”，似也可通。这又是一个“诗无达诂”的例子。\n三四两句“况属高风晚，山山黄叶飞”，写诗人在山中望见的实景，也含有从《九辩》“悲哉秋之为气也，萧瑟兮草木遥落而变衰”两句化出的意境。就整首诗来说，这两句所写之景是对一二两句所写之情起衬映作用的，而又有以景喻情的成分。这里，秋风萧瑟、黄叶飘零的景象，既用来衬映旅思乡愁，也可以说是用来比拟诗人的萧瑟心境、飘零旅况。当然，这个比拟是若即若离的。同时，把“山山黄叶飞”这样一个纯景色描写的句子安排在篇末，在写法上又是以景结情。南宋沈义父在《乐府指迷》中说：“结句须要放开，含有余不尽之意，以景结情最好。”这首诗的结句就有宕出远神、耐人寻味之妙。\n诗歌在艺术上常常是抒情与写景两相结合、交织成篇的。明代谢榛在《四溟诗话》中说：“作诗本乎情、景。……景乃诗之媒，情乃诗之胚，合而为诗。”这首诗，前半抒情，后半写景。但诗人在山中、江边望见的高风送秋、黄叶纷飞之景，正是产生久客之悲、思归之念的触媒；而他登山临水之际又不能不是以我观物，执笔运思之时也不能不是缘情写景，因此，后半首所写之景又必然以前半首所怀之情为胚胎。诗中的情与景是互相作用、彼此渗透、融合为一的。前半首的久客思归之情，正因深秋景色的点染而加浓了它的悲怆色彩；后半首的风吹叶落之景，也因旅思乡情的注入而加强了它的感染力量。\n王勃还有一首《羁春》诗：“客心千里倦，春事一朝归。还伤北园里，重见落花飞。”诗的韵脚与这首《山中》诗完全相同，抒写的也是羁旅之思，只是一首写于暮春，一首写于晚秋，季节不同，用来衬托情意的景物就有“落花飞”与“黄叶飞”之异。两诗参读，有助于进一步了解诗人的感情并领会诗笔的运用和变化。\n现代译文：\n\n\n⑴滞（zhì）：淹留。一说停滞，不流通。\n⑵万里：形容归程之长。念将归：有归乡之愿，但不能成行。\n⑶况属：何况是。属：恰逢，正当。高风：山中吹来的风。一说即秋风，指高风送秋的季节。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2222","poet":"唐代
