佚名\n正文：有瞽有瞽，在周之庭。\n设业设虡，崇牙树羽。\n应田县鼓，鞉磬柷圉。\n既备乃奏，箫管备举。\n喤々厥声，肃雍和鸣，先祖是听。\n我客戾止，永观厥成。\n分类：诗经 音乐\n创作背景：此诗是表现周王祭祀先祖时乐队齐奏的盛况。在先秦时代的政治生活中，乐具有特殊重要的地位，而且往往与礼密切相关联。《礼记·乐记》云：“乐者，天地之和也；礼者，天地之序也。和，故百物皆化；序，故群物皆别。乐由天作，礼由地制，过制则乱，过作则暴。明于天地，然后能兴礼乐也。”《周颂·有瞽》是描写作乐的篇章，《毛诗序》认为是“始作乐而合乎祖”，郑笺以“王者治定制礼，功成作乐”释之，正反映了礼乐并重的传统观念。\n周代有选用先天性盲人担任乐官的制度，据《周礼·春官·序官》记载，其中的演奏人员有“瞽蒙，上瞽四十人，中瞽百人，下瞽百有六十人”，计三百人；另有“眡瞭三百人”，贾公彦疏说“眡瞭，目明者，以其扶工”，即是在乐队中配备视力正常的人做盲人乐师的助手。可见，当时王室乐队的规模相当庞大。《周颂·有瞽》正是王室乐队演奏壮观场面的记录。\n文学赏析：“有瞽有瞽，在周之庭”，说明在宗庙上奏乐的主体是瞽；而“设业设虡”、安置乐器的则当是担任瞽的辅佐的眡瞭。乐器则列举了应、田、鞉、磬、柷、圉、箫管，与《周礼·春官》所载“瞽蒙掌播鼗、柷、敔、埙、箫管、弦歌”基本相符，其中柷为起乐、圉（敔）为止乐之器，以首尾涵盖，表示这次演奏动用了全套乐器而“八音克谐”（《尚书·舜典》），“喤喤厥声，肃雝和鸣”，其音乐自然十分美妙。\n周颂三十一篇都是乐诗，但直接描写奏乐场面的诗作惟《周颂·执竞》与此篇《周颂·有瞽》。《周颂·执竞》一诗，“钟鼓喤喤，磬筦将将，降福穰穰，降福简简”，虽也写了作乐，但也落实于祭祀降福的具体内容。惟有《周颂·有瞽》几乎纯写作乐，最后三句写到“先祖”“我客”，也是点出其“听”与“观”，仍归结到乐的本身，可见这乐便是《周颂·有瞽》所要表达的全部，而这乐所包含的意义，在场的人（周王与客）、王室祖先神灵都很明了，无须再加任何文字说明。因此，《周颂·有瞽》所写的作乐当为一种定期举行的仪式。《礼记·月令》：“季春之月……是月之末，择吉日，大合乐，天子乃率三公、九卿、诸侯、大夫亲往视之。”高亨《诗经今注》认为这即是《周颂·有瞽》所描写的作乐。从作乐的场面及其定期举行来看，大致两相符合，但也有不尽一致之处。其一，高氏说“大合乐于宗庙是把各种乐器会合一起奏给祖先听，为祖先开个盛大的音乐会”，而《礼记·月令》郑玄注则说“大合乐以助阳达物风化天下也，其礼亡，今天子以大射、郡国以乡射礼代之”，目的一空泛、一具体；其二，高氏说“周王和群臣也来听”，《礼记·月令》则言天子率群臣往视，音乐会的主办者便有所不同了。另外，高氏说“据《礼记·月令》，每年三月举行一次”，《月令》原文是“季春之月”，按周历建子，以十一月为岁首，“季春之月”便不是“三月”了。可见要确指《有瞽》作乐是哪一种仪式，还有待进一步考证。\n《周颂·有瞽》这一纯写作乐过程的诗篇，不仅表现了周王朝音乐成就的辉煌，而且也显示了周人“乐由天作”因而可以之沟通入神的虔诚观念。\n现代译文：盲人乐师排成行，聚集周庙前庭上。钟架鼓架摆设好，五彩羽毛架上装。既有小鼓和大鼓，鞉磬柷敔列停当。乐器齐备就演奏，箫管一齐都奏响。众乐交响声洪亮，肃穆和谐声悠扬，先祖神灵来欣赏。诸位宾客都来到，乐曲奏完齐赞赏。\n⑴瞽（gǔ）：盲人。这里指周代的盲人乐师。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1894","poet":"先秦
