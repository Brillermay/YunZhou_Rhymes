佚名\n正文：信彼南山，维禹甸之。\n畇畇原隰，曾孙田之。\n我疆我理，南东其亩。\n上天同云。\n雨雪雰雰，益之以霡霂。\n既优既渥，既沾既足。\n生我百谷。\n疆埸翼翼，黍稷彧彧。\n曾孙之穑，以为酒食。\n畀我尸宾，寿考万年。\n中田有庐，疆埸有瓜。\n是剥是菹，献之皇祖。\n曾孙寿考，受天之祜。\n祭以清酒，从以骍牡，享于祖考。\n执其鸾刀，以启其毛，取其血膋。\n是烝是享，苾苾芬芬。\n祀事孔明，先祖是皇。\n报以介福。\n万寿无疆。\n分类：诗经 田园\n文学赏析：此诗首章写开疆拓土，开篇言：“信彼南山，维禹甸之。”诗人是在描述周代的京畿地区。在诗人看来，这畿内的大片土地就是当年大禹治水时开辟出来的。毛传训“甸”为治，而郑笺则落实为：“禹治而丘甸之。”“丘甸”即指田地划分中的两个等级。《周礼·地官·小司徒》云：“乃经土地而井牧其田野：九夫为井，四井为邑，四邑为丘，四丘为甸，四甸为县，四县为都，以任地事而令贡赋。”因而郑笺等于坐实井田制起源于夏代。孔疏承郑笺之说，谓“是则三王之初而有井甸田里之法也”，“是则丘甸之法，禹之所为”。尽管有的学者认为大禹治水“未及丘甸其田也。且井邑丘甸出调法，虞夏之制未有闻焉”（孔疏引孙毓说），但郑、孔之说也不无参考意义。\n首章末二句云：“我疆我理，南东其亩。”也值得注意。疆理田土也是古代井田制的一个重要方面。《孟子·滕文公上》云：“夫仁政必自经界始。经界不正，井地不均，谷禄不平，是故暴君污吏必慢其经界。经界既正，分田制禄可坐而定也。”可见古人对经理田界是非常重视的。毛传释此诗云：“疆，画经界也。理，分地理也。”有的学者解释得更为具体，如王安石说：“疆者，为之大界；理者，衡从（横纵）其沟涂。”（《吕氏家塾读诗记》引）吕氏又引长乐刘氏说云：“疆谓有夫、有畛、有涂、有道、有路，以经界之也。理谓有遂、有沟、有洫、有浍、有川，以疏导之也。”刘氏之说当是依据《周礼·地官·遂人）“凡治野，夫间有遂，遂上有径。十夫有沟，沟上有畛。百夫有洫，洫上有涂。千夫有浍，浍上有道。万夫有川，川上有路，以达于畿”。这里所谓“南东其亩”也与井田制有关。此句指顺应地形、水势而治田，南指其田陇为南北向者，东则为东西向者，此即《齐风·南山》所云“衡从其亩”。郑笺释曰：“‘衡’即训为横。韩诗云：东西耕曰‘横’。‘从’……韩诗作‘由’，云：南北耕曰‘由’。”《左传·成公二年》载：晋郤克伐齐，齐顷公使上卿国佐求和于晋营，晋人要求“使齐之封内尽东其亩”，也就是使齐国的陇亩全部改为东西向，这样晋国一旦向齐国进兵，就可长驱直入。国佐回答晋人说：“先王疆理天下物土之宜，而布其利，故《诗》曰：‘我疆我理，南东其亩。’今吾子疆理诸侯，而曰尽东其亩而已，唯吾子戎车是利，无顾土宜，其无乃非先王之命也乎？”国佐引此篇为据，说明先王当初定田土之疆界是根据不同的地势因地制宜的，既有南北向，也有东西向的田陇，如今晋国为了军事上的便利而强令齐国改变田陇的走向，是违反了先王之道。此事又见诸其他典籍，但情节上有些出入。如《韩非子·外储说右上》云：“晋文公伐卫，东其亩。”《吕氏春秋·简选）云：“晋文公东卫之亩。”郭沫若引成公二年事云：“这也正好是井田的一种证明。因为亩道系以国都为中心，故有南北纵走与东西横贯的两种大道。南北纵走的是南亩，东西横贯的就是东亩。《诗》上所说的‘我疆我理，南东其亩’，就是这个事实。……这些资料好像与井田制并无直接关系，而其实它们正是绝好的证明。”（《十批判书·古代研究的自我批评》）\n第二章写风调雨顺。天上彤云密布，瑞雪纷纷，加之小雨如酥，润泽大地，五谷丰登。\n第三章写酒食祭祖。地界整齐，庄稼茂盛，曾孙收获，酿造美酒，敬祭神主，厚待宾客，静享清福，万寿无疆。\n第四章写瓜菹献祭。田中有庐，地畔种瓜，剥削干净，腌渍上供，敬献先祖。曾孙长命百岁，都是受上天佑护。\n第四章中的“中田有庐”，说者也以为与井田有关。《吕氏家塾读诗记》引邱氏说云：“公田百亩内，除二十亩为八家治田之庐。”又引董氏曰：“井九百亩，其中为公田，八家每家庐舍二亩半。”按《孟子·公孙丑上》述井田云：“方里而井，井凡百亩，其中为公田。八家皆私百亩，同养公田。”《榖梁传·宣公十五年》称：“古者三百步为一里，名曰井田。井田者九百亩，公田居一”，“古者公田为居，井灶葱韭尽取焉”。范宁注：“此除公田八十亩，余八百二十亩。故井田之法，八家共一井八百亩。除二十亩，家合二亩半为庐舍”，“八家共居”。《韩诗外传》载：“古者八家而井田。方里为一井。……八家为邻，家得百亩。余夫各得二十五亩。家为公田十亩，余二十亩共为庐舍，各得二亩半。八家相保，出入更守，疾病相忧，患难相救，有无相贷，饮食相招，嫁娶相谋，渔猎分得，仁恩施行，足以其民和亲而相好。《诗》曰：‘中田有庐，疆埸有瓜。’”以上诸说大同小异，有一点是共同的，即公田中有八家共居的庐舍二十亩。说诗者多从其说，但笺疏别有所解。郑笺云：“中田，田中也。农人作庐...","metadata":{"poem_id":"1117","poet":"先秦
