佚名\n正文：鸡既鸣矣，朝既盈矣。\n匪鸡则鸣，苍蝇之声。\n东方明矣，朝既昌矣。\n匪东方则明，月出之光。\n虫飞薨薨，甘与子同梦。\n会且归矣，无庶予子憎。\n分类：诗经\n文学赏析：自汉迄今，对《鸡鸣》的阐释大致经历以下三种不同的方式：第一种是“诗人介入式”的解读方式，以唐代孔颖达的《毛诗正义》最为典型，其句读为：“鸡既鸣矣，朝既盈矣。”匪鸡则鸣，苍蝇之声。“东方明矣，朝既昌矣。”匪东方则明，月出之光。“虫飞薨薨，甘与子同梦。会且归矣，无庶予子憎。”孔颖达认为，《鸡鸣》首次两章上两句为夫人之言，下两句是诗人对夫人话语的评判。卒章皆为夫人之辞。在诗中，始终是夫人在说话，男子没有言语，诗人介入其中，起解说作用。第二种是“半联句体”解读方式，以清代方玉润《诗经原始》为代表，其句读为：“鸡既鸣矣，朝既盈矣。”“匪鸡则鸣，苍蝇之声。”“东方明矣，朝既昌矣。”“匪东方则明，月出之光。”“虫飞薨薨，甘与子同梦。会且归矣，无庶予子憎。”方玉润认为，首次两章上两句为夫人言，下两句是丈夫言，末章全是夫人言。第三种是“问答联句体”，以程俊英为代表，在《诗经注析》中提出，其句读为：“鸡既鸣矣，朝既盈矣。”“匪鸡则鸣，苍蝇之声。”“东方明矣，朝既昌矣。”“匪东方则明，月出之光。”“虫飞薨薨，甘与子同梦。”“会且归矣，无庶予子憎。”程俊英等认为，首次两章上两句为夫人言，下两句是丈夫言，末章上两句是丈夫言，而下两句是夫人言。\n此诗的主题，《毛诗序》以为是“思贤妃”，说：“（齐）哀公荒淫怠慢，故陈贤妃贞女夙夜警戒相成之道焉。”宋朱熹《诗集传》则以为是直接赞美贤妃。而宋严粲《诗缉》以为是“刺荒淫”，清崔述《读风偶识》以为是“美勤政”，清方玉润《诗经原始》以为是“贤妇警夫早朝”。也许此诗只是表现一对贵族夫妇私生活的情趣。全诗以夫妇间对话展开，构思新颖，在《诗经》中是别开生面的。姚际恒说：“愚谓此诗妙处须于句外求之。”（《诗经通论》）本来这对夫妇的对话是非常质朴显露的，谈不上有什么诗味妙语，只因为有的类似傻话、疯话，叫人会心发笑，包含着“无理见趣”之妙。古制，国君鸡鸣即起视朝，卿大夫则提前入朝侍君，《左传·宣公二年》载赵盾“盛服将朝，尚早，坐而假寐”即是。此诗开头写妻子提醒丈夫“鸡既鸣矣，朝既盈矣”，丈夫回答“匪鸡则鸣，苍蝇之声”。想来鸡啼、苍蝇飞鸣古今不会大变，如非听觉失灵，不至二者不分。从下面二、三章妻子所云“东方明矣”“会且归矣”，可知当是鸡鸣无疑。而丈夫把“鸡鸣”说成“苍蝇之声”，是违背生活常识的，当然“无理”。但如果换一角度理解，看作是丈夫梦中被妻子唤醒，听见妻子以“鸡鸣”相催促，便故意逗弄妻子说：不是鸡叫，是苍蝇声音，表现了他们夫妇间的生活情趣，也是别有滋味。“反常”而合乎夫妇情感生活之“道”，这正是姚氏所指出的妙在句外。下两章时间由鸡鸣至天亮，官员由已上朝至快散朝，丈夫愈拖延愈懒起，故意把天明说成“月光”，贪恋衾枕，缠绵难舍，竟还想与妻子同入梦乡，而妻子则愈催愈紧，最后一句“无庶予子憎”已微有嗔意。表现夫妇私生活，可谓“真情实境，写来活现”（姚际恒《诗经通论》）。\n此诗句式以四言为主，杂以五言，句式错综，接近散文化。押韵亦有其特点，头两章四句皆用韵，而首句与次句韵脚同在第三字，而末尾是语助词“矣”，也算韵，王力先生称这为“富韵”。另外第一、二章首句与第三句韵脚同字。第三章则是第一、二、四句押韵，也可见此诗用韵富有变化。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"4872","poet":"先秦
