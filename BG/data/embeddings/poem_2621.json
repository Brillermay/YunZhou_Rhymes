苏味道\n正文：火树银花合，星桥铁锁开。\n暗尘随马去，明月逐人来。\n游伎皆秾李，行歌尽落梅。\n金吾不禁夜，玉漏莫相催。\n分类：节日 元宵节\n创作背景：据刘肃《大唐新语·文章》载：武则天时，正月十五夜京城大放花灯，金吾弛禁，特许夜行，观灯者人山人海。文士数百人赋诗纪事，当时以苏味道、郭利贞、崔液三人所作为绝唱。然而，郭、崔二人所作，人们早已淡忘，唯有本篇传诵不绝。\n苏味道武则天时居相位数年，居洛阳次北宣风坊。此诗大约作于武则天神龙元年正月（705年），描写的即是武则天时期神都元夜的景象。也有学者认为，此诗作于武则天长安元年（也即大足元年正月，701年）。\n文学赏析：这首诗是描写长安城里元宵之夜的景色。据《大唐新语》和《唐两京新记》记载：每年这天晚上，长安城里都要大放花灯；前后三天，夜间照例不戒严，看灯的真是人山人海。豪门贵族的车马喧阗，市民们的歌声笑语，汇成一片，通宵都在热闹的气氛中度过。\n春天刚刚才透露一点消息，还不是万紫千红的世界，可是明灯错落，在大路两旁、园林深处映射出灿烂的辉光，简直象明艳的花朵一样。从“火树银花”的形容，我们不难想象，这是多么奇丽的夜景！说“火树银花合”，因为四望如一的缘故。王维《终南山》“白云回望合”，孟浩然《过故人庄》“绿树村边合”的“合”，用意相同，措语之妙，可能是从这里得到启发的。由于到处任人通行，所以城门也开了铁锁。崔液《上元夜》诗有句云：“玉漏铜壶且莫催，铁关金锁彻明开。”可与此相印证。城关外面是城河，这里的桥，即指城河上的桥。这桥平日是黑沈沈的，今天换上了节日的新装，点缀着无数的明灯。灯影照耀，城河望去有如天上的星河，所以也就把桥说成“星桥”了。“火树”“银花”“星桥”都写灯光，诗人的鸟瞰，首先从这儿着笔，总摄全篇；同时，在“星桥铁锁开”这句话里说出游人之盛，这样，下面就很自然地过渡到节日风光的具体描绘。\n人潮一阵阵地涌着，马蹄下飞扬的尘土也看不清；月光照到人们活动的每一个角落，哪儿都能看到明月当头。原来这灯火辉煌的佳节，正是风清月白的良宵。在灯影月光的映照下，花枝招展的歌妓们打扮得分外美丽，她们一面走，一面唱着《梅花落》的曲调。长安城里的元宵，真是观赏不尽的。所谓“欢娱苦日短”，不知不觉便到了深更时分，然而人们却仍然怀着无限留恋的心情，希望这一年一度的元宵之夜不要匆匆地过去。“金吾不禁”二句，用一种带有普遍性的心理描绘，来结束全篇，言尽而意不尽，读之使人有余音绕梁，三日不绝之感。这诗于镂金错采之中，显得韵致流溢，也在于此。\n现代译文：\n\n\n①火树银花：比喻灿烂绚丽的灯光和焰火。特指上元节的灯景。此句对后世影响甚大，如宋辛弃疾《青玉案·元夕》词有：“东风夜放花千树……蓦然回首，那人却在灯火阑珊处。”《红楼梦》十八回：“只见庭燎绕空，香雪布地，火树琪花，金窗玉槛”\n② 星桥：星津桥，天津三桥之一，“洛水贯都，以像星汉”此处或以星津桥指代天津三桥。”东都洛阳，洛水从西面流经上阳宫南，流到皇城端门外，分为三道，上各架桥，南为星津桥，中为天津桥，北为黄道桥[2] 。开元年间，改修天津桥，星津桥毁，二桥合而为一。[3]\n③ 铁锁开：比喻京城开禁。唐朝都城都有宵禁，但在正月十五这天取消宵禁，连接洛水南岸的里坊区与洛北禁苑的天津桥、星津桥、黄道桥上的铁锁打开，任平民百姓通行。\n④ 暗尘：暗中飞扬的尘土。\n⑤ 逐人来：追随人流而来。\n⑥ 游伎：歌女、舞女。一作“游骑（jì）”\n⑦秾李：此处指观灯歌伎打扮得艳若桃李。《诗经·召南·何彼秾矣》：“何彼秾矣，华如桃李。”\n⑧落梅：曲调名。\n⑨金吾：原指仪仗队或武器，此处指金吾卫，掌管京城戒备，禁人夜行的官名，汉代置。《唐两京新记》云：”正月十五日夜，敕金吾弛禁，前后各一日以看灯，光若昼日。”\n⑩ 不禁夜：指取消宵禁。唐时，京城每天晚上都要戒严，对私自夜行者处以重罚。一年只有三天例外，即正月十四、十五、十六[5] 。\n⑪ 玉漏：古代用玉做的计时器皿，即滴漏。\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"2621","poet":"唐代 苏味道","title":"正月十五夜","category":"节日 元宵节"},"cacheTime":1750777129357}
