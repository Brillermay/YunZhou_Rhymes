咏史怀古\n文学赏析：此诗与《大雅·生民》《大雅·公刘》《大雅·緜》《大雅·皇矣》《大雅·文王》诸篇相联缀，俨然形成一组开国史诗。从始祖后稷诞生、经营农业，公刘迁豳，太王（古公亶父）迁岐，王季继续发展，文王伐密、伐崇，直到武王克商灭纣，可以说是把每个重大的历史事件都写到了，所以研究者多把它们看作一组周国史诗，只是《诗经》的编者没有把它们按世次编辑在一起，而打乱次序分编在各处。朱熹说它和《大雅·文王》那篇一样，“追述文王之德，明周家所以受命而代商者，皆由于此，以戒成王”。其实此诗很难看出是周公所作，也很难看出有警戒成王的意思。总观这组六篇诗文，不过是周王朝统治者为歌颂祖先功德，追述开国历史的显赫罢了。\n全诗八章。历代各家的分章稍有不同，这里是根据诗意确立的。第一、二、四、七章章六句，第三、五、六、八章章八句。排列起来，颇有参差错落之美。\n首章先从赞叹皇天伟大、天命难测说起，以引出殷命将亡、周命将兴，是全诗的总纲。次章即歌颂王季娶了太任，推行德政。三章写文王降生，承受天命，因而“以受方国”。四章又说文王“天作之合”，得配佳偶。五章即写他于渭水之滨迎娶殷商帝乙之妹。六章说文王又娶太姒，生下武王。武王受天命而“燮伐大商”，与首章遥相照应。七章写武王伐纣的牧野之战，敌军虽盛，而武王斗志更坚。最后一章写牧野之战的盛大，武王在姜尚辅佐之下一举灭殷。全诗时序井然，层次清楚，俨然是王季、文王、武王三代的发展史。\n诗篇以“天命所佑”为中心思想，以王季、文王、武王三代相继为基本线索，集中突现了周部族这三代祖先的盛德。其中，武王灭商，是此诗最集中、最突出要表现的重大历史事件，写王季、太任、文王、太姒，不过是说明周家奕世积功累仁，天命所佑，所以武王才克商代殷而立天下。所以，诗人著笔，历述婚媾，皆天作之合，圣德相配。武王克商，也是上应天命、中承祖德、下合四方的。因此，尽管诗意变幻不已，其中心意旨是非常清楚的。全诗虽然笼罩着祀神的宗教气氛和君权神授的神学色彩，其内在的历史真实性一面，还是有认识价值的。\n这是一首叙事诗，但它并不平铺直叙地叙事。文王两次迎亲的描述，生动具体；牧野之战的描绘，更显得有声有色。“牧野洋洋，檀车煌煌，驷騵彭彭”一连三个排比句子，真可谓把战争的威严、紧迫的气势给和盘托出了。“殷商之旅，其会如林”，虽然写出了敌军之盛，但相比之下，武王的三句誓师，更显得坚强和有力。“维师尚父，时维鹰扬”，虽然仅仅描写了一句，也似乎让人看到了姜太公的雄武英姿。至于它有详有略、前呼后应的表现手法，更使诗篇避免了平铺、呆板和单调，给人以跌宕起伏、气势恢宏而重点突出的感觉。这些，在艺术上都是可取的。诗中的“小心翼翼”、“天作之合”等句也早已成为著名的成语，在现代汉语中仍有很强的活力。\n现代译文：皇天伟大光辉照人间，光采卓异显现于上天。天命无常难测又难信，一个国王做好也很难。天命嫡子帝辛居王位，终又让他失国丧威严。\n\n1.明明：光采夺目的样子。在下：指人间。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1406","poet":"先秦
