讽刺\n文学赏析：与后代一些讽谕诗“卒章显其志”的特点相反，作者开宗明义，一开始就用简练的语言，明确说出作诗劝谏的目的和原因。首二句以“上帝”对“下民”，前者昏乱违背常道，后者辛苦劳累多灾多难，因果关系十分明显。这是一个高度概括，以下全诗的分章述写，可以说都是围绕这两句展开的。\n对于“上帝”（指周厉王）的“板板”，作者在诗中作了一系列的揭露和谴责。先是“出话不然，为犹不远。靡圣管管，不实于亶”，不但说话、决策没有依据，而且无视圣贤，不讲信用；接着是在“天之方难”、“方蹶”、“方虐”和“方懠”时，一味地“宪宪”、“泄泄”、“谑谑”和“夸毗”，面临大乱的天下，还要纵情作乐、放荡胡言和无所作为；然后又是以“蹻蹻”之态，听不进忠言劝谏，既把老臣的直言当作儿戏，又使国人缄口不言，简直到了“不可救药”的地步。\n对于“下民”的“卒瘅”，作者则倾注了极大的关心和同情。他劝说历王改变政令，协调关系，使人民摆脱苦难，融洽自安（“辞之辑矣，民之洽矣。辞之怿矣，民之莫矣”）；他为了解民于水火，大胆进言，甘冒风险（“民之方殿屎，则莫我敢葵。丧乱蔑资，曾莫惠我师”）；同时，他又不厌其烦地向厉王陈述“天之牖民”之道，强调对国人的疏导要像吹奏埙篪那样和谐，对民众的提携要像佩带璋圭那样留心；最后他还意味深长地把人民比作国家的城墙，提醒厉王好自为之，不要使城墙毁于一旦，自己无地自容。\n作为谴责和同情的汇聚和结合，作者对厉王的暴虐无道采取了劝说和警告的双重手法。属于劝说的，有“无然”三句、“无敢”两句，“无为”、“无自”、“无俾”、“无独”、“勿以”、“匪我”各一句，可谓苦口婆心，反覆叮咛，意在劝善，不厌其烦；属于警告的，则有“多将熇熇，不可救药”、“昊天曰明，及尔出王。昊天曰旦，及尔游衍”等句，晓以利害，悬戒惩恶。这种劝说和警告的并用兼施，使全诗在言事说理方面显得更为全面透彻，同时也表现了作者忧国忧民的一片拳拳之心，忠贞可鉴。\n在这首诗中，最可注意的有两点：一是作者的民本思想。他不仅把民众比作国家的城墙，而且提出了惠师牖民的主张，这和邵公之谏在某种意义上说是相通的，具有积极的进步作用。二是以周朝传统的敬天思想，来警戒厉王的“戏豫”和“驰驱”的大不敬，从而加强了讽谕劝谏的力度。如果不是冥顽不化的亡国之君，对此是应当有所触动的。\n至于全词多用正言直说，也使其更具后代谏书的作用，作者心胸之坦荡、感情之激切于此可见一斑。而叠字的多处运用、比喻对照的生动工整等，又使它保持了诗歌的艺术性。这首《板》与另一首《荡》同以讽刺厉王著称后世，以至“板荡”成了形容政局混乱、社会动荡的专用词，其影响之大，不难想见。\n现代译文：上帝昏乱背离常道，下民受苦多病辛劳。说出话儿太不像样，作出决策没有依靠。无视圣贤刚愎自用，不讲诚信是非混淆。执政行事太没远见，所以要用诗来劝告。\n\n1.板板：反，指违背常道。\n\n","metadata":{"poem_id":"1606","poet":"先秦
